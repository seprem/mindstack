/* Design Lab, worked examples.

   Each project is grown stage by stage. A stage may only add a box if it can
   name the pressure that made the previous stage fail, and every box carries
   its own reasoning, the alternatives that lost, what it costs and how it
   breaks. That is the whole idea: the diagram is the answer, the reasoning is
   the interview.

That is a spike of expensive operations, and the natural client behaviour, reconnect immediately, makes it worse each time it fails.<br><br>Three defences, and they are mostly in the client. Exponential backoff <i>with jitter</i>, so retries spread out instead of arriving in waves. A cap on the sync batch, so a device with a month of backlog does not ask for all of it in one request.

There is no server side link preview, so the client fetches it and leaks the link to the previewer instead. Backup becomes a key management problem rather than a storage one, and multi device becomes a key distribution problem rather than a fan-out one.<br><br>Say this out loud even if encryption is out of scope. Naming the boxes a constraint removes shows a different kind of understanding than adding boxes does, and it is the fastest way to demonstrate that you know what encryption costs rather than just that it is good." }

    { n: "Why a normal index cannot answer where is the nearest driver",
      note: "An index on latitude finds everyone in a horizontal band that wraps the planet. An index on longitude finds a vertical one. Intersecting them means fetching two enormous sets to keep a tiny one, and the database will usually choose one index and filter the rest, which is a scan wearing a costume.<br><br>Space filling curves fix this by mapping two dimensions to one while mostly preserving locality. Geohash interleaves the bits of latitude and longitude, so a shared prefix means physical proximity and a prefix range becomes an ordinary index range. S2 and H3 do the same thing more carefully: S2 uses a Hilbert curve on the surface of a cube, and H3 uses hexagons, which have the pleasant property that all six neighbours are the same distance away, unlike a square's edges and corners.<br><br>All of them have the same seam problem: two points either side of a cell boundary can be metres apart and share no prefix, which is exactly why you always read the neighbouring cells too and filter by real distance afterwards. Getting that detail right is the difference between knowing the name of the technique and knowing the technique." },

    { n: "The double assignment, and why a cache cannot prevent it",
      note: "Two riders in the same cell, two matching processes, one driver. Both read the index, both see the driver, both offer. If the driver's app shows two offers and they tap both, or if a retry duplicates an acceptance, you have one car and two passengers.<br><br>A cache cannot arbitrate this, because the index is a stale view by construction. The arbitration has to happen on a durable store with a real condition. Two conditional updates in one transaction, the trip's driver where it is null and the driver's current trip where it is null, and the loser's transaction affects zero rows and rolls back. No lock is held across the network, no coordinator exists, and the failure mode of every component involved is a clean rejection.<br><br>The generalisable lesson, which is the reason this problem is asked: <b>read from the fast stale thing, decide on the slow correct thing.</b> Candidate generation and arbitration are different jobs with different guarantees, and mixing them is where the newspaper stories come from." },

    { n: "Sharding by city, and why geography is the right key",
      note: "A ride starts and ends in the same city. Almost every query, index lookup and trip is local to one, and nothing needs to join across two. That makes city the natural shard key, and it comes with three benefits that are worth saying out loud: a city is a failure domain, so an outage is local; a city has its own peak hour, so load is naturally spread across shards by timezone; and pricing, regulation and supply are already per city in the business, so the technical boundary matches the organisational one.<br><br>The awkward cases are worth naming before the interviewer does. Airports sit between cities and need explicit ownership. Long trips can cross a boundary, so the trip belongs to the city it started in and stays there. And a city like Delhi is a hundred times the size of a small one, so cities are not shards, they are assigned to shards, and the biggest ones get a shard to themselves." },

    { n: "Greedy matching versus batched matching",
      note: "Greedy matching assigns each request to the best available driver the moment it arrives. It is simple, it has the lowest latency, and in a dense area it is measurably worse: assigning the nearest driver to whoever asked first can leave a later request with a driver ten minutes away, when a swap would have served both in three.<br><br>Batched matching collects requests over a short window, a second or two, and solves an assignment problem over the whole set. The improvement is real in dense cells and negligible in sparse ones, and it costs everybody the window in latency. So run both: greedy where supply is loose, batched where the demand to supply ratio is above some threshold, which is a number the aggregator already computes for surge. That is a nice property of this design worth pointing at: the signal that triggers surge is the same signal that should switch the matching mode." }

Correct, and every cinema in the country now queues behind every other, which is a scalability answer of no. <b>Per show</b>: what this design uses. Shows never interact, so there is zero cross show contention, and within a show a couple of hundred seats and tens of concurrent users means the critical section is microseconds. <b>Per seat</b>: maximum concurrency, and two bookings wanting seats A and B in opposite orders will deadlock, which is why the seat list is sorted before acquiring. Worth mentioning that you know the fix even though you did not need it. <b>Lock free</b>: a compare and swap per seat status, which is elegant for one seat and needs a hand written rollback for all-or-nothing over several.<br><br>The reasoning to say out loud is that the right granularity is the aggregate that owns the invariant. The invariant here is one booking per seat within a show, the Show owns the seat map, so the Show is the lock. That sentence generalises to every LLD problem with concurrency in it." },

    { n: "Never hold a lock across an external call",
      note: "This is the single most common LLD mistake and it survives code review because it looks harmless. Payment takes two seconds. If it happens inside the synchronized block, one user's slow card blocks every other booking for that show for two seconds, and if the gateway hangs for thirty, the hall is frozen for thirty.<br><br>The fix is the expiry. Because a lock carries a deadline, the claim can be released from the monitor immediately after being recorded: the seat is still reserved, but no thread is blocked. The monitor protects the check and the claim, which is microseconds, and the eight minute reservation is data rather than a held lock.<br><br>Stated as a rule: <b>a monitor protects a decision, not a duration.</b> If something needs to be reserved for minutes, that is a record with a timestamp, not a thread holding a lock." },

So the choice is not between derived and stored. It is between derived, and derived with a cache you have to keep honest.<br><br>At the scale in the brief, a few thousand entries per group, the fold is microseconds and the cache is unnecessary.

Netting them to five transfers is objectively fewer payments, and the greedy algorithm, repeatedly match the largest debtor to the largest creditor, gets to at most n-1 transfers and is trivial to write. The truly minimal number is an NP-hard partitioning problem, and with twenty people it is still instant, so you can have the exact answer if you want it.<br><br>The part worth arguing is not the algorithm. Simplification creates debts between people who never transacted: Anita ends up paying Rahul for a dinner Rahul did not attend. Users find that confusing, and occasionally they object for reasons that have nothing to do with arithmetic. Real products treat this as opt in for exactly that reason.<br><br>So: greedy, opt in, and always keep the pairwise history available so the question <i>why do I owe this person</i> has an answer.

Nothing crashes, nothing is inconsistent, and the group now owes twice what it should, which is a worse kind of bug because every component behaved correctly.<br><br>There is no purely technical fix, because the two expenses are genuinely indistinguishable from a legitimate pair of identical rounds at the same bar. What you can do is reduce the damage. <b>A client supplied id</b> makes one phone's retry idempotent, which handles the more common case of a flaky connection. <b>A duplicate warning</b>, same amount, same group, within a few minutes, catches the human case and lets a human decide. <b>An easy reversal</b> means the fix is one tap rather than a support conversation.<br><br>The generalisable point, and the reason this is a good closing question: some duplicates are a concurrency problem and some are a product problem, and the ledger is what makes the second kind cheap to correct." }

If one goroutine takes the pool lock and then reaches for the ring, while another takes the ring lock and then reaches for the pool, both stop and neither ever resumes. This is lock inversion, it is not detected by the race detector, and it typically appears the first time production traffic makes both paths run at once.<br><br>There are two standard answers. <b>A global lock ordering</b>: decide that the pool lock is always taken before the ring lock, everywhere, and never the reverse. It works and it relies on every future contributor knowing the rule. <b>Never hold two</b>: copy what you need out from under the first lock, release it, then take the second. This codebase does the second, in both directions, and comments say why.<br><br>The cost of the second approach is that the copied set is a snapshot, so between the copy and the ring lookup a backend might change health. Here that costs one misrouted request, which the passive health check catches. Being able to name what the snapshot costs is what makes it a decision rather than a shortcut." },

Add a fourth backend to three and roughly three quarters of all clients move, which for anything holding per client state in memory is a stampede.<br><br>A ring fixes the remapping: backends are placed at positions around a circle, a client hashes to a position, and the first backend clockwise wins. Adding a backend only steals the arc immediately before it, so about one client in N moves rather than most of them.<br><br>The catch is that N randomly placed points give wildly unequal arcs, so with three backends one might take half the traffic. Virtual nodes fix that: place each backend at 150 positions instead of one, and the law of large numbers flattens the distribution to within a few percent. 150 is the number most implementations converge on, because the improvement flattens out above it and the memory is linear.<br><br>The last detail is the one people miss.

So if you run two copies of this balancer for availability, which is the reason the rate limiter was made shared in the first place, you get two pools that disagree. A backend registered against instance A is invisible to instance B. A backend that fails a request on A is still healthy on B and keeps receiving traffic. Consistent hashing produces different answers on the two instances for the same client, so the affinity it exists to provide is gone.<br><br>Three ways out, in increasing order of how much they change. <b>Put the pool in Redis too</b>, with the health flag as a key with a TTL that whichever instance detects a failure clears.

    "<b>Shared pool state.</b> Either in Redis or behind service discovery, so a second instance is actually a second instance rather than a second opinion.",
    "<b>Proxy correctness.</b> Strip hop by hop headers, add X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto, stream the request body instead of buffering it, and move the admin routes off the public listener behind a token."
