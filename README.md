# Mindstack

Interview prep notes. Two ways in:

- **Concepts** (`concept.html`), one concept per page, in a fixed order: a stepped visual,
  plain words, why it works from first principles, the same hard part again in Hinglish,
  costs and traps, pseudocode plus Python / Java / C++ / JavaScript, questions to check
  yourself, and practice. The explanations are language-agnostic; language specifics live in
  their own table.
- **Revision** (`revise.html`), every concept as the one line worth remembering, with its
  questions. Answer them out loud, then open them.

- **Design Lab** (`design.html`), seven real systems worked end to end. Each architecture is
  grown stage by stage, and a stage may only add a box if it can name the pressure that broke
  the previous one. Click any box for why it exists, what lost the argument, what it costs and
  how it fails.

Plus the original sheets: DSA notes, a one-day sheet, the patterns roadmap, and LLD / HLD /
HR one-pagers.

This is a shared repo, so nothing records what any reader has done, no checkboxes, no
progress meters, no per-person state. The only things kept in the browser are the colour
theme and which code tab you last looked at.
