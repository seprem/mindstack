  group: "Fundamentals",
  one: "Big-O is the <b>shape of the growth curve</b>, not the speed. It answers one question: if the input gets 10× bigger. What happens to the work?",

  plain: `<p>Two programs solve the same problem. One takes 5 seconds on your laptop, the other 8 seconds. Which is better? <b>You cannot tell yet.</b> Ask instead: what happens when the input goes from 1,000 items to 1,000,000?</p>
<p>The 5-second one might become 5 hours. The 8-second one might become 9 seconds. Big-O measures <b>that</b>, how the work grows with the input, and deliberately throws away everything else: the constant factors, the language, the CPU, the coffee break.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> You are told a road trip takes "about 4 hours". Useless. Is that with traffic, in a truck, at night? But "the time doubles every extra 100 km" tells you something real about the <i>road</i>, no matter what car you drive. Big-O describes the road, not the car.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "Compare the algorithm, not the computer",
      d: "How many seconds your code takes depends on the machine, the language, and what else is running. None of that is about the algorithm. So we stop counting seconds and start counting <b>steps</b>." },
    { t: "Constants do not matter, growth does",
      d: "Is <code>3n</code> better than <code>5n</code>? Barely, a faster machine erases that gap. What no machine can erase is the gap between <code>n</code> and <code>n²</code>. So we throw away the constants and keep only the growth." },
    { t: "Only the biggest term survives",
      d: "Take <code>n² + 1000n</code>. At n = a million, the n² part is a thousand times bigger than the other. The small term stops mattering, so we write just <b>O(n²)</b>." },
    { t: "Read it off the shape of the code",
      d: "One loop → <b>O(n)</b>. A loop inside a loop → <b>O(n²)</b>. Halving the problem each step → <b>O(log n)</b>. Sorting → <b>O(n log n)</b>. Two recursive calls per level → <b>O(2ⁿ)</b>. Loops one after another <i>add</i>; nested loops <i>multiply</i>." },
    { t: "Space is measured the same way, and the stack counts",
      d: "Half of judging an algorithm is memory, and it is the half people forget to state. Count anything that grows with the input: the hash map you built, the array you copied, and the <b>call stack</b>. A recursive solution with no data structures at all is still O(depth) space, which is why a depth of 10⁵ crashes rather than merely slows. Give both numbers unprompted; being asked for the space complexity is a sign you should have said it already." },
    { t: "Always say which case you mean",
      d: "A hash map is O(1) on <i>average</i> and O(n) at <i>worst</i>. Quicksort is O(n log n) average and O(n²) worst. Best, average and worst are three different claims about three different things, and answering with the wrong one is not a rounding error." },
    { t: "Amortised is a fourth claim, and it is not the average",
      d: "Average case is about the distribution of <i>inputs</i>: on typical data, this is what happens. <b>Amortised</b> is about a <i>sequence of operations</i>: any n appends cost under 2n in total, so each is O(1), and that is a <b>guarantee</b> rather than a hope. An adversary can defeat an average case by choosing nasty input, and cannot defeat an amortised bound at all. Saying \"average\" when you mean \"amortised\" gives away that the distinction has not landed." },

<p><b>Code dekh kar kaise batayein?</b> Ek loop = <b>O(n)</b>. Loop ke andar loop = <b>O(n²)</b>. Har step mein problem aadhi ho rahi hai (binary search) = <b>O(log n)</b>. Sort = <b>O(n log n)</b>. Har call se do naye call ban rahe hain (plain recursion) = <b>O(2ⁿ)</b>.</p>

  plain: `<p>Memory is one long strip of numbered slots. A variable is a name for one slot. A small fixed-size value like an integer fits in that slot directly, but a list, an object or a string has no size known in advance, so it cannot.</p>
<p>Instead the object is built somewhere else in memory, and the slot holds its <b>address</b>. That address is what a pointer is. A reference is the same idea with the dereferencing hidden from you.</p>
<p>Everything surprising follows from that one fact. <code>b = a</code> copies the slot, which means it copies the address, so both names now describe the same object. Change it through one and the other sees the change, because there was only ever one object.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> A slip of paper with a house address on it. Photocopy the slip and you have two slips, not two houses. Anyone who follows either slip walks into the same living room and can move the furniture.</p>`,

Nothing is duplicated, nothing is allocated, and there is still one object, now with two names pointing at it. That is <b>aliasing</b>, and it is not a language quirk; it is the only thing assignment could sensibly mean." },
    { t: "Which is why a function can change your list", d: "Arguments are copied too, but again it is the <b>address</b> that gets copied. So the function has its own name for your object and can mutate it. It cannot, however, make your variable point somewhere else, because it only got a copy of the arrow. This is exactly why reassigning a parameter does nothing to the caller while calling <code>.append</code> on it does." },
    { t: "Copying has depth, and shallow is the default", d: "A copy of a list duplicates the <b>outer</b> container and its addresses. Anything those addresses point to is still shared.

A deep copy follows every arrow and duplicates all the way down." },
    { t: "Immutable objects make all of this disappear", d: "You can only observe aliasing by <i>changing</i> something. If an object cannot change, a string, a number, a tuple, then sharing it is invisible and completely safe. That is a large part of why languages make strings immutable, and why immutable values are safe to use as hash-map keys and to hand between threads." },
    { t: "Two lifetimes: the frame dies, the object need not", d: "Local names live in a <b>stack frame</b> that is discarded when the function returns. The object they point to lives elsewhere, on the <b>heap</b>, and survives as long as something still points at it. Garbage-collected languages free it when nothing does; C++ makes it your job, and returning the address of a dead local is the classic dangling-pointer bug." },

  plain: `<p>Three things about numbers cause real bugs, and none of them are obvious until they bite.</p>
<p><b>Integers have edges.</b> A 32-bit <code>int</code> stops at about 2.1 billion. Go past it and it does not raise an error or saturate. It <b>wraps around to a large negative number</b> and carries on as if nothing happened.</p>
<p><b>Integer division has to choose a direction</b>, and languages disagree. <code>-7 / 2</code> is <code>-3</code> in Java, C++ and JavaScript, but <code>-4</code> in Python. Modulo inherits the disagreement, so <code>-7 % 3</code> is <code>-1</code> in one family and <code>2</code> in the other.</p>
<p><b>Floats are binary fractions.</b> 0.1 cannot be written exactly in binary any more than 1/3 can be written exactly in decimal, so <code>0.1 + 0.2</code> is not <code>0.3</code>.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> A car odometer with five digits. At 99999 the next mile does not read 100000 and it does not refuse. It reads 00000, and nothing anywhere records that it happened.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "A fixed-width integer is a fixed number of bits, so it has edges", d: "32 bits hold 2³² distinct patterns. Signed, that is −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. There is no room for anything larger, so the hardware does the only thing it can: it keeps the low 32 bits and discards the carry. The value <b>wraps</b>, silently and at full speed." },
    { t: "Which is why the classic binary-search line is a bug", d: "<code>(lo + hi) / 2</code> can overflow even when the answer is perfectly representable, because the intermediate sum is not. Writing <code>lo + (hi - lo) / 2</code> computes the same value without ever forming the large sum. This bug sat in the JDK for nine years." },
    { t: "Integer division must round, and the two families round oppositely", d: "-3.5 has to become an integer. C, C++, Java, Go and JavaScript <b>truncate toward zero</b> and give −3; Python <b>floors</b> toward negative infinity and gives −4. On non-negative numbers the two agree completely, which is exactly why the difference stays hidden until it matters." },
    { t: "Modulo follows division, so its sign follows too", d: "The two must satisfy <code>a == (a/b)*b + a%b</code>. Truncating division therefore gives a remainder with the sign of the <b>dividend</b> (−7 % 3 = −1), while flooring gives the sign of the <b>divisor</b> (−7 % 3 = 2). When you need an index, write <code>((x % n) + n) % n</code>. It is non-negative everywhere." },
    { t: "Floats trade exactness for range", d: "A double stores a binary fraction, so any value that is not a sum of powers of two, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3. Is stored approximately. The errors are tiny but real, and they accumulate. So never test floats for equality; compare against a small tolerance, or avoid floats entirely by scaling to integers (work in cents, not in rupees)." },
    { t: "The practical rules that follow", d: "Use 64-bit when a product or a sum might grow, <code>a * b</code> overflows long before <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> do. Check <i>before</i> multiplying rather than after (<code>a &gt; limit / b</code>), because the overflowed result tells you nothing. And know your language: Python integers grow without limit, so none of this applies until you port the solution somewhere else." },

<p><b>Isliye binary search ki woh famous line galat hai:</b> <code>(lo + hi) / 2</code>. Answer to range mein hai, par beech ka <b>jodh</b> range se bahar chala jaata hai. Sahi likho: <code>lo + (hi - lo) / 2</code>. Yeh bug Java ki library mein <b>9 saal</b> chhupa raha tha.</p>
<p><b>2. Integer division kis taraf ghumaaye?</b> -3.5 ko poora number banana hai. C, C++, Java, JavaScript <b>zero ki taraf</b> kaatte hain → <b>-3</b>. Python <b>neeche (floor)</b> jaata hai → <b>-4</b>. Positive numbers par dono barabar, isiliye yeh farak chhupa rehta hai.</p>
<p><b>3. Modulo bhi wahi ghumaav follow karta hai.</b> <code>-7 % 3</code> Java/C++ mein <b>-1</b>, Python mein <b>2</b>. Jab index chahiye (circular array, hash bucket), to hamesha likho:<br><code>((x % n) + n) % n</code>, yeh har jagah non-negative dega. <b>Yeh line yaad kar lo.</b></p>
<p><b>4. Float exact nahi hota.</b> Jaise decimal mein 1/3 poora nahi likha jaata, waise binary mein 0.1 poora nahi likha jaata. Isliye <code>0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3</code>. Float ko kabhi <code>==</code> se mat compare karo, thoda tolerance rakho, ya paisa "rupees" ki jagah "paise" (integer) mein rakho.</p>
<p><b>Practical niyam:</b> jahan guna ya jodh bada ho sakta hai wahan <b>64-bit (long)</b> use karo, <code>a * b</code> bahut pehle overflow ho jaata hai. Aur check <b>guna karne se pehle</b> karo (<code>a > limit / b</code>), baad mein nahi, overflow hone ke baad result se kuch pata nahi chalta. Python mein integers apne aap bade ho jaate hain, isliye yeh dikkat tab tak nahi jab tak solution Java/C++ mein na le jao.</p>`,

  one: "Almost every number question is four moves: <b>stop at the square root</b>, cross out multiples, replace a with a mod b, and halve the exponent.",

  plain: `<p>Number theory sounds like a university course. The interview version is six short routines, and every one of them exists because the obvious approach does far too much work.</p>
<p>Is n prime? You do not need to try every divisor, only the ones up to √n. Which numbers below a million are prime? Do not ask each one separately, cross out the multiples instead. What is the largest number dividing both a and b? Do not factorise either of them, just keep replacing the pair with a smaller pair. What is 2 to the power of a billion? Do not multiply a billion times, square your way there in thirty steps.</p>
<p>The last piece is the modulus. Problems ask for an answer <code>mod 10⁹ + 7</code> so the result fits in a 64-bit integer, which means you keep every intermediate value small instead of computing something astronomical and shrinking it at the end. Addition, subtraction and multiplication survive that treatment. Division does not, and the fix for division is most of the remaining difficulty.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> Checking whether a rectangle of area n can be made from whole-number sides. You only ever measure the short side, because once you pass the square the long side has already been on your list.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "A factor above the square root drags a partner below it", d: "If <code>n = a × b</code> and both a and b were larger than √n, their product would already exceed n. So at least one factor is <b>at or below √n</b>. Test 2, 3, 4 up to √n, find nothing, and there is nothing to find. That single sentence is the whole of primality testing at interview level: <b>O(√n)</b>, and you can say why." },
    { t: "Asking every number separately repeats the same work", d: "To list primes up to n, trial division costs about n√n. But the moment you know 2 is prime you also know 4, 6, 8, 10 are not, without dividing anything. So invert the question: instead of testing each number, take each prime and <b>cross out its multiples</b>. Every composite gets struck by its own prime factors, so whatever survives is prime." },
    { t: "The inner loop starts at p × p, not 2p", d: "Any multiple of p below p × p is <code>k × p</code> with <code>k &lt; p</code>, so it has a prime factor smaller than p and was crossed out on an earlier pass. Starting at p × p skips all of that. It also means the outer loop can stop once <code>p × p &gt; n</code>. The total is <b>O(n log log n)</b>, which is near enough linear that you should treat it as free. The log log comes from summing 1/p over the primes, and it is not something anyone derives at a whiteboard. Quote it, do not prove it." },
    { t: "For a gcd, subtract the pair down instead of factorising it", d: "Suppose d divides both a and b. Write <code>a = q × b + r</code>. Then <code>r = a - q × b</code>, and d divides both terms on the right, so <b>d divides r too</b>. The common divisors of (a, b) and of (b, a mod b) are therefore exactly the same set, so the largest one is the same: <code>gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b)</code>. Repeat until b hits 0, and the answer is a. The remainder at least halves every two steps, so this is <b>O(log min(a, b))</b>." },
    { t: "lcm comes free from gcd, if you order the arithmetic properly", d: "Each of a and b contributes its own factors, and the shared part is counted once, so <code>lcm(a, b) = a × b / gcd(a, b)</code>. Write it as <code>a / gcd(a, b) * b</code> instead. The gcd divides a exactly, so nothing is lost, and you never form the product <code>a × b</code>, which is the value that overflows. See the numbers concept for what that overflow actually does to you." },
    { t: "Powers halve instead of counting down", d: "<code>x¹⁶</code> does not need sixteen multiplications. Square four times. In general <code>x^e</code> is <code>(x^(e/2))²</code> when e is even, and <code>x × x^(e-1)</code> when it is odd, so each step either halves the exponent or makes it even. That is <b>O(log e)</b> multiplications. Take the modulus after every single one and no intermediate ever exceeds m², which is precisely why the answer is asked for mod 10⁹ + 7." },
    { t: "Mod distributes over three operations, and pointedly not the fourth", d: "<code>(a + b) mod m</code>, <code>(a - b) mod m</code> and <code>(a × b) mod m</code> can all be computed from the reduced values, because remainders add and multiply the way you hope. <b>Division cannot.</b> Dividing by b becomes multiplying by the <b>modular inverse</b> of b, the value with <code>b × inv ≡ 1 (mod m)</code>. When m is prime, Fermat gives it away: <code>b^(m-1) ≡ 1</code>, so <code>inv = b^(m-2) mod m</code>, one fast power. That is how nCr survives a modulus: precompute factorials and their inverses, then <code>nCr = fact[n] × invfact[r] × invfact[n-r]</code>. What this cannot do: a non-prime modulus (Fermat does not apply, you need the extended Euclidean algorithm), and it will not factorise a 200-digit number for you either. None of these routines break big integers apart, they only avoid having to." },

  hing: `<p><b>Poore number theory ka interview version chhe chhoti routines hai.</b> Har ek isliye exist karti hai kyunki seedha tarika bekaar mein zyada kaam karta hai.</p>
<p><b>1. √n tak hi kyun?</b> Maan lo <code>n = a × b</code>. Agar a aur b dono √n se bade hote, to unka product n se bada ho jaata, jo ho nahi sakta. Matlab <b>kam se kam ek factor √n ke neeche ya barabar hoga</b>. To 2 se √n tak dekh lo, kuch nahi mila to number prime hai. Bas itni si baat, aur interview mein isse zyada primality test chahiye bhi nahi.</p>
<p><b>2. Sieve, har number se poochho mat, kaat do.</b> Ek-ek number ko test karne ke bajaye, har prime ke <b>multiples cross</b> kar do. Har composite apne hi prime factor se mar jaayega, jo bacha woh prime.</p>
<p><b>Sabse poochha jaane wala sawaal: inner loop <code>p * p</code> se kyun shuru hota hai, <code>2p</code> se kyun nahi?</b> Kyunki <code>p * p</code> se chhota koi bhi multiple <code>k × p</code> hai jismein <code>k &lt; p</code>. Us number ka ek chhota prime factor pehle se hai, aur woh <b>pehle hi round mein kat chuka hai</b>. Dobara kaatne ka koi fayda nahi. Cost <b>O(n log log n)</b> hai. Yeh log log kahan se aaya, yeh interview mein derive karne ki cheez nahi hai, bas bol do aur aage badho.</p>
<p><b>3. GCD ka one-line proof, yaad kar lo.</b> Agar d, a aur b dono ko divide karta hai, aur <code>a = q × b + r</code>, to <code>r = a - q × b</code>. Right side ke dono terms d se divide hote hain, isliye <b>d, r ko bhi divide karta hai</b>. Matlab (a, b) aur (b, a mod b) ke common divisors bilkul same hain, to sabse bada bhi same: <code>gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b)</code>. b zero hone tak repeat karo.</p>
<p><b>4. lcm mein order galat mat karna.</b> <code>lcm = a / gcd(a, b) * b</code> likho, <code>a * b / gcd</code> nahi. gcd, a ko poora divide karta hai to kuch khota nahi, par <code>a * b</code> banaya to woh <b>overflow</b> kar sakta hai. Overflow kya karta hai, woh numbers wale concept mein detail se hai.</p>
<p><b>5. Fast power.</b> <code>x^16</code> ke liye 16 baar guna mat karo, chaar baar square kar lo. Exponent ko aadha karte jao, <b>O(log e)</b> steps. Aur har step ke baad <code>% m</code> lagao, tabhi number chhota rehta hai. Isiliye problems answer <code>mod 10⁹ + 7</code> maangte hain.</p>
<p><b>6. Mod ke saath division kaam nahi karta.</b> Plus, minus, multiply, teeno mod ke andar theek chalte hain. <b>Divide nahi.</b> b se divide karne ke liye uska <b>modular inverse</b> chahiye, matlab woh number jiska <code>b × inv</code> mod m mein 1 ho. Jab m prime hai (aur 10⁹ + 7 prime hai), Fermat se: <code>inv = power(b, m - 2, m)</code>. Isi se nCr nikalta hai: factorials aur unke inverses pehle bana lo, phir har query O(1).</p>
<p><b>Ek warning:</b> Fermat sirf <b>prime modulus</b> par chalta hai, aur tabhi jab b, m ka multiple na ho. Modulus prime nahi hai to extended Euclid chahiye, aur woh alag kahani hai.</p>`,

  plain: `<p>Every integer you have ever used is stored as a row of bits, each worth twice the one to its right. Bit manipulation is not a separate branch of mathematics. It is just addressing those switches directly instead of politely going through arithmetic.</p>
<p>There are four things you can do to a bit: set it, clear it, flip it, or ask whether it is on. All four are the same two steps. Build a mask with a shift, then combine it with AND, OR or XOR.</p>
<p>Most of the time this buys you nothing that a boolean array would not, and costs you readability. It earns its place in exactly two situations: when you need a set of up to about 32 items to fit in a single integer (bitmask DP, subsets, visited states), and when XOR's cancelling property turns an O(n) space problem into an O(1) space one.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> A row of light switches on a wall. You can flip one, or you can hold a stencil over the wall and flip everything showing through the holes. The stencil is the mask. That is genuinely the entire concept.</p>`,

Shifting left by one moves every bit up a position, which doubles the number; shifting right halves it and throws away the remainder. So <code>1 &lt;&lt; k</code> is \"a single 1, sitting in position k\", which is how every mask gets built." },
    { t: "The three operators do the three jobs, and no others", d: "<b>OR</b> turns bits on and never turns any off, so it sets. <b>AND</b> keeps only what both sides agree on, so with an inverted mask it clears, and with a single-bit mask it tests. <b>XOR</b> differs, so it flips. Once you see which operator has which personality you stop memorising the four idioms." },
    { t: "XOR is the one with a real superpower", d: "<code>a ^ a = 0</code> and <code>a ^ 0 = a</code>. Together those mean XOR-ing a whole array cancels out every value that appears an even number of times and leaves the odd one standing. Finding the single unpaired number takes <b>O(n) time and O(1) space</b>, with no hash map and no sorting. It is also symmetric and order-independent, so you can do it in any order you like." },
    { t: "A number is a set, if you squint", d: "Bit i on means \"item i is in the set\". Now union is OR, intersection is AND, membership is one AND, and the whole set is a single integer you can use as a dictionary key or a DP state. That is the actual reason bitmask DP exists: 2<sup>n</sup> subsets become 2<sup>n</sup> integers, which a machine handles comfortably up to about n = 20." },
    { t: "The identities worth knowing, and the ones that are just showing off", d: "<code>x &amp; (x - 1)</code> clears the lowest set bit, because subtracting one flips that bit off and everything below it on.

Everything beyond those is a party trick, and your language has a built-in for it anyway." },
    { t: "The sharp edges are all about width and sign", d: "Shifting by more than the width is undefined in C++ and quietly wraps in Java. Right-shifting a negative number copies the sign bit, which is why Java has a separate <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.

  plain: `<p>A 2-D array is not a new data structure. It is an array whose elements happen to be arrays, which is why <code>grid[r][c]</code> means "row r, then column c inside it".</p>
<p>That ordering is the source of an embarrassing share of grid bugs, and they hide well: on a square grid, swapping row and column produces a wrong answer rather than a crash, so your code runs, returns something plausible, and fails the one test case that uses a rectangle.</p>
<p>The other half of grid work is neighbours. Nearly every grid problem asks about the cells next to a cell, so the four directions get written out as a list of <code>(dr, dc)</code> pairs once and looped over, rather than copied and pasted four times with the third one subtly wrong.</p>
<p>Everything else is bounds checking, and bounds checking is only interesting because Python will not do it for you. A negative index does not fail there. It cheerfully wraps to the far end of the grid and hands you a confidently incorrect result.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> A spreadsheet. Nobody says "column C, row 4", they say "C4" and then get it backwards in code anyway.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "Rows of rows, so the row index comes first", d: "<code>grid</code> holds row objects; <code>grid[r]</code> is one row; <code>grid[r][c]</code> is a cell in it. So the number of rows is <code>len(grid)</code> and the number of columns is <code>len(grid[0])</code>, which quietly assumes there is a row 0. An empty grid is a real input and it will find you." },
    { t: "Each row is a separate object, and that matters more than it sounds", d: "Because the rows are independent objects, building a grid by repeating one row hands you the same row several times over. Writing to one apparently writes to all of them. This is not a grid problem, it is the aliasing rule from the memory page arriving in a costume." },
    { t: "Neighbours are data, not control flow", d: "Write the four offsets as <code>[(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]</code> and loop. Four hand-written branches means four bounds checks, which means one of them is wrong, which means a bug that only appears on the top edge. Diagonals are four more pairs in the same list and nothing else changes." },
    { t: "Check bounds before indexing, not after", d: "<code>0 &lt;= nr &lt; rows and 0 &lt;= nc &lt; cols</code>, evaluated first. Java and C++ throw or corrupt memory, which is at least honest. Python treats <code>grid[-1]</code> as the last row and returns an answer from the opposite corner of the board, which is considerably worse than a crash." },
    { t: "The classic transforms are two boring steps, not one clever one", d: "Rotating a matrix 90 degrees in place looks like it needs a spiral and four-way swaps. It does not: <b>transpose, then reverse each row</b>. Transposing means swapping <code>grid[r][c]</code> with <code>grid[c][r]</code> only where <code>c &gt; r</code>, because doing it for every cell swaps each pair twice and returns you politely to the start." },
    { t: "A grid is a graph that never needed building", d: "Every cell is a node and every legal move is an edge, so flood fill is DFS, shortest path on an open grid is BFS, and you never construct an adjacency list because the coordinates already are one. This is why grid questions are really graph questions wearing a rectangle, and why this page exists before the graph pages." },

  hing: `<p><b>2-D array koi nayi cheez nahi hai.</b> Yeh bas ek array hai jiske andar arrays hain. Isiliye <code>grid[r][c]</code> ka matlab hai: pehle <b>row</b> r, phir uske andar column c.</p>
<p><b>Aur yahi sabse zyada galtiyon ki jagah hai.</b> Square grid par row aur column ulta kar do, to program crash nahi karega. Woh chalega, jawaab dega, aur woh jawaab galat hoga. Pakda tab jaayega jab koi rectangle wala test case aayega.</p>
<p><b>Rows alag-alag objects hote hain.</b> Isiliye ek row ko repeat karke grid banaoge to wahi ek row baar-baar mil jaayegi, aur ek cell badalne par saari rows badli dikhengi. Yeh grid ki problem nahi hai, yeh <b>memory wale page ka aliasing</b> hai jo naye kapdon mein aa gaya.</p>
<p><b>Padosi (neighbours) ko data banao, code nahi.</b> Chaar directions ek list mein likho: <code>[(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]</code>, aur loop chala do. Chaar alag if likhoge to chaar bounds check likhne padenge, aur unme se ek galat hoga. Woh bug sirf kinare wali row par dikhega, aur tab tak tum kuch aur dhoondh rahe hoge.</p>
<p><b>Bounds pehle check karo, index baad mein.</b> Java aur C++ to crash kar denge ya memory kharab kar denge, jo kam se kam <b>imaandaar</b> hai. Python <code>grid[-1]</code> ko aakhri row maan leta hai aur board ke doosre kone se jawaab utha kar de deta hai. Crash se yeh zyada khatarnak hai.</p>
<p><b>90 degree rotate karna:</b> log isme spiral aur chaar-chaar swap sochne lagte hain. Zaroorat nahi. Do boring steps: <b>transpose karo, phir har row ko ulta kar do</b>. Transpose mein swap sirf wahan karo jahan <code>c &gt; r</code> hai, warna har pair do baar swap hoga aur grid waise ka waisa reh jaayega.</p>
<p><b>Aur sabse important baat aage ke liye:</b> grid asal mein ek <b>graph</b> hai jise banane ki zaroorat hi nahi padi. Har cell ek node, har legal move ek edge. Isliye flood fill = DFS, aur shortest path = BFS. Adjacency list banane ki zaroorat nahi kyunki coordinates khud hi adjacency hain. Isi wajah se yeh page graph wale pages se pehle hai.</p>`,

<p>So in an immutable-string language, what does <code>s += "b"</code> do? It creates an entirely new string, copies the old contents in, appends 'b', and points <code>s</code> at the new object. The old one is thrown away. Do that in a loop and step <i>i</i> copies <i>i</i> characters, the total is 1+2+3+…+n, which is n²/2.</p>

  plain: `<p>Three questions look similar and are not: are these the same object, are they equal, and which one comes first. Languages answer them with different operators, and disagreeing with your language about which question you asked is a fine way to spend an afternoon.</p>
<p><b>Identity</b> asks whether two names point at one object. <b>Equality</b> asks whether two objects have the same contents. For built-in values the distinction rarely bites. For your own types it decides whether a hash set can find them at all.</p>
<p>Then there is <b>ordering</b>, which is what sorting needs. A comparator is a promise about a total order, and the promise has rules. Break them and the standard library is entitled to do anything it likes, up to and including crashing, and C++ takes that entitlement seriously.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> Two identical twins. Same appearance, so equal. Different people, so not identical. If the school files them by appearance alone, one of them is going to get the other's report card.</p>`,

    { t: "A hash map asks the hash first and equality second", d: "Look-up computes the hash to find a bucket, then uses equality to pick the right entry inside it. So the two must agree: <b>equal objects must produce the same hash</b>. If they do not, the map searches the wrong bucket, finds nothing, and reports that your key is absent while holding it a few slots away. This is the contract, and it is the reason it exists." },
    { t: "The reverse is not required, and cannot be", d: "Unequal objects may share a hash. They have to: there are unlimited possible values and a fixed number of hashes. That is why the map still runs an equality check after finding the bucket, and why a hash on its own is never proof of equality." },
    { t: "And this is why keys must be immutable", d: "The bucket is chosen from the contents. Mutate a key after inserting it and its hash changes, so it is now filed under an address nobody will look at. The entry is not deleted, it is unreachable, which is worse: it still occupies the map and still turns up when you iterate. Immutability is not a purity preference here, it is the only way the mechanism holds together." },
    { t: "Ordering is a third question with its own rules", d: "A comparator must be a genuine total order: consistent (a before b implies b never before a), transitive, and honest about ties. Return a boolean where a three-way answer is expected, or claim both a &lt; b and b &lt; a, and you have not merely produced odd output. C++ calls it undefined behaviour and may run off the end of the array; Java throws \"Comparison method violates its general contract\", generally in production." },
    { t: "Sorting by two keys is where stability quietly matters", d: "Sort by the secondary key, then by the primary, and a <b>stable</b> sort keeps the first ordering intact inside each group. With an unstable sort the same code produces correct output on small inputs and wrong output on large ones, because whether it reorders equal items depends on the algorithm's internal state. Alternatively, compare both keys in one comparator and stop depending on a property your language may not have." },

<p><b>Identity</b> do addresses compare karta hai, hamesha O(1). <b>Equality</b> andar ka content compare karta hai. Java mein <code>==</code> objects par <b>address</b> compare karta hai, isliye do alag-alag bani strings barabar hote hue bhi <code>==</code> mein false dete hain. Isiliye <code>.equals()</code> use karna hai.</p>
<p><b>Ab asli baat, hash map kaam kaise karta hai:</b> pehle <b>hash</b> se bucket dhoondta hai, phir us bucket ke andar <b>equality</b> se sahi entry chunta hai. Matlab dono mein <b>samjhauta</b> hona chahiye:</p>
<p><b>Jo objects barabar hain, unka hash bhi ek hona chahiye.</b> Agar aisa nahi hua, to map galat bucket mein dhoondega, kuch nahi milega, aur tumse kahega ki key hai hi nahi. Jabki key uske paas hi padi hai, do slot door. Yeh sabse chidhane wala bug hai kyunki code bilkul sahi dikhta hai.</p>
<p><b>Ulta zaroori nahi hai:</b> alag objects ka hash same ho sakta hai, aur hoga hi, kyunki values infinite hain aur hashes limited. Isiliye bucket milne ke <b>baad</b> bhi equality check hoti hai.</p>
<p><b>Aur isiliye keys immutable honi chahiye.</b> Bucket contents se decide hota hai. Key ko daalne ke baad badal do, to uska hash badal gaya, aur ab woh aisi jagah padi hai jahan koi dhoondne nahi jaayega. Woh delete nahi hui, bas <b>pahunch se bahar</b> ho gayi, jo delete hone se zyada buri baat hai kyunki iterate karne par ab bhi dikhegi.</p>
<p><b>Comparator ke apne niyam hain.</b> Woh ek <b>sachcha total order</b> hona chahiye: consistent, transitive, aur ties ke baare mein imaandaar. Agar tumne dono ko ek doosre se chhota bata diya, to C++ ise <b>undefined behaviour</b> maanta hai aur array ke bahar chala ja sakta hai. Java "Comparison method violates its general contract" phenk deta hai, aksar production mein.</p>
<p><b>Do keys par sort:</b> pehle chhoti key, phir badi. <b>Stable</b> sort pehla order har group ke andar bacha leta hai. Par agar sort stable nahi hai (C++ ka <code>sort</code>), to yeh code chhote input par sahi aur bade input par galat chalega. Sabse safe: ek hi comparator mein dono keys compare kar lo aur stability par bharosa hi mat rakho.</p>`,

<p><b>Sabse zaroori practical baat:</b> queue ke liye <code>list.pop(0)</code> kabhi mat use karna. Woh <b>O(n)</b> hai kyunki saare elements khisakte hain. <code>collections.deque</code> use karo, <code>popleft()</code> <b>O(1)</b>. Yeh galti BFS ko O(V+E) se chupke se O(V²) bana deti hai, aur bade test case par TLE deti hai.</p>
<p><b>Recursion = stack.</b> Har call mein local variables aur return address stack par push hote hain. Isliye gehri recursion RecursionError deti hai, aur isiliye <b>koi bhi recursion</b> explicit stack se iterative banayi ja sakti hai.</p>
<p><b>Monotonic stack (yeh zaroor samajhna):</b> "next greater element" pehli nazar mein O(n²) lagta hai.

<p>That is binary search, and the reason it works is <b>order</b>. In an unsorted pile, seeing one wrong element tells you nothing about the others. In a sorted one, seeing "the middle is too small" tells you about the middle <i>and everything to its left</i> in a single comparison. Sorting is the price; discarding half per step is what you buy.</p>
<p><b>The bigger idea.</b> Binary search is not really about arrays. It applies to any question where the answer space is ordered and you can ask "is <i>this</i> candidate good enough?". That includes answers you compute rather than store, which is where the harder interview questions live.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "One comparison can be worth one item, or half of them",
      d: "In a jumbled pile, checking one item tells you nothing about the others, so you are stuck at O(n). In a sorted list, learning \"the middle is too small\" also tells you every item to its left is too small. Order is what turns one comparison into a bulk decision." },

      d: "\"Sorted\" is just the usual way to get there. What you actually need is a question whose answer is no, no, no, …, yes, yes, yes across the range. Once you see it that way, \"first item ≥ x\" and \"smallest k that works\" are the same algorithm." },
    { t: "So you can search the answer, not the list",
      d: "\"What is the smallest ship capacity that finishes in D days?\" Capacities are ordered, and \"does capacity c finish in time?\" flips from no to yes exactly once. So binary search the <b>capacity</b>, and check each guess with a simple loop. The array is never searched at all, and this is where the harder questions live." },
    { t: "Every bug is the range failing to shrink",
      d: "If some branch can leave both ends where they were, the loop spins forever. Fix it by construction: loop while <code>lo &lt; hi</code>, and move with <code>lo = mid + 1</code> or <code>hi = mid</code>. Now the range provably gets smaller every time." },

<p><b>log n kahan se aaya?</b> n → n/2 → n/4 → … → 1. Kitni baar aadha karna pada? n/2^k = 1 → k = <b>log₂n</b>. 10 lakh elements = sirf ~20 steps. Yeh optimisation nahi, <b>growth class ka badalna</b> hai.</p>

<p><b>Sabse bada unlock, answer par binary search.</b> "Minimum capacity kya ho ki D din mein saara saamaan chala jaaye?" Yahan array par search nahi karte, <b>answer ki range</b> par karte hain.

  plain: `<p>An array keeps everything in one unbroken block, which is what makes <code>a[i]</code> instant and what makes inserting in the middle expensive. A linked list makes the opposite trade.</p>
<p>Each item becomes a <b>node</b>: a value, plus the address of the next node. The nodes can live anywhere in memory, in any order. The only thing holding the sequence together is the chain of addresses.</p>
<p>So splicing something in is just rewriting two of those addresses, no shifting, no copying, no resizing. And getting to the fiftieth item means following forty-nine arrows, because there is no arithmetic that can jump there.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> A treasure hunt. Each clue tells you where the next clue is. Adding a new stop is easy, rewrite one clue and slip yours in. But there is no way to skip to clue 50; you walk the whole trail.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "Ask what contiguity was costing us", d: "An array is fast to index precisely because everything is packed together, and expensive to insert into for exactly the same reason. So the question is: what if we drop that requirement entirely?" },
    { t: "Then every item has to say where the next one is", d: "Without a fixed layout, position can no longer be computed, so it must be <b>stored</b>. Each node becomes value + next-address. The order lives in the pointers, not in the memory layout." },
    { t: "What you buy: rewiring instead of shifting", d: "To insert between two nodes you point the new node at the second and the first at the new node. <b>Two writes, O(1)</b>, regardless of list length, and no reallocation ever, because nothing needs to be contiguous." },
    { t: "What you pay: no address arithmetic", d: "Reaching position i means following i pointers, <b>O(n)</b>, and binary search becomes impossible because there is no cheap way to find the middle. You also pay one pointer of memory per node, and every hop lands somewhere unrelated in memory, so the cache cannot help you. The constant factor is genuinely worse than the Big-O suggests." },
    { t: "So the O(1) insert has a condition attached", d: "It is O(1) only once you are <i>already holding</i> the node. Insert at a given index is O(n) to walk there plus O(1) to rewire. That distinction is what interview questions are built on: problems are shaped so you arrive at the right node by other means, a fast pointer, a previous pointer, a hash map." },
    { t: "A dummy head deletes half the bugs", d: "Most linked-list bugs are the special case \"what if it is the head?\". Put one throwaway node in front of the real list and the head stops being special: every node now has a previous node, and you return <code>dummy.next</code> at the end." },
    { t: "Reversal is the archetype, and it needs three pointers", d: "The moment you point <code>curr.next</code> backwards, you have destroyed your only route forward. So the loop is always: <b>save next, flip, advance</b>. Everyone who writes it with two pointers loses the rest of the list." },

  hing: `<p><b>Array ki dikkat kya thi?</b> Sab kuch ek saath, judaa hua rakhna padta hai. Isi wajah se <code>a[i]</code> turant milta hai, aur isi wajah se beech mein kuch daalna mehnga hai. Linked list ne bilkul <b>ulta sauda</b> kiya hai.</p>
<p><b>Naya idea:</b> har item ab ek <b>node</b> hai, value, aur agle node ka <b>pata (address)</b>. Nodes memory mein kahin bhi pade ho sakte hain, kisi bhi order mein. Sequence ko sirf yeh arrows jod kar rakhte hain.</p>
<p><b>Faayda:</b> beech mein insert karna matlab sirf <b>do pointers</b> badalna. Kuch khisakna nahi, kuch copy nahi, <b>O(1)</b>.</p>
<p><b>Nuksan:</b> ab position <b>calculate</b> nahi hoti, isliye i-th node tak pahunchne ke liye i arrows follow karne padte hain, <b>O(n)</b>. Binary search yahan possible hi nahi, kyunki beech wala node sasta mein milta hi nahi. Upar se har node ka apna pointer memory khaata hai aur har hop memory mein kahin door jaata hai, to <b>cache</b> madad nahi kar pata. Practically array se dheema hai, chahe Big-O barabar dikhe.</p>
<p><b>Yeh baat sabse zaroori hai:</b> insert O(1) tabhi hai jab tum <b>us node par pehle se khade ho</b>. "i-th position par insert karo" to O(n) hi hai, chalna to padega.

<p><b>Dummy head ka jugaad:</b> aadhe bugs sirf isliye aate hain ki "agar head hi delete karna ho to?". Ek nakli node list ke aage laga do, ab head special nahi raha, har node ka ek previous hai. Aakhir mein <code>dummy.next</code> return kar do. Bahut saare if-else khatam.</p>
<p><b>Reverse karna (yeh zaroor samajhna):</b> jaise hi tumne <code>curr.next</code> ko peeche modha, aage jaane ka raasta khatam.

<p>That is why trees are shallow. A million nodes arranged in a line is a million steps deep; the same million arranged as a balanced tree is about twenty. Every fast tree operation is really just "the depth is small".</p>
<p>The second consequence is structural. A node's left child is itself a perfectly good tree, so any solution that works for the whole thing works for the part, which is why tree code is almost always recursive and almost always short.</p>

  plain: `<p>Binary search is wonderful and needs a sorted array, which is wonderful until something needs inserting, at which point half the array shuffles along to make room.</p>
<p>A search tree keeps the halving and drops the shuffling. Put a middling value at the root, everything smaller in the left subtree, everything larger in the right, and repeat. Now finding a value is the same sequence of decisions binary search makes, except the decisions are baked into the shape instead of recomputed from indices.</p>
<p>Insert costs the same walk, and nothing moves afterwards because there is no contiguous block to maintain. You have traded array locality for the ability to insert in the middle without apologising to everything after it.</p>
<p>There is one condition, and the whole page hinges on it: the tree has to stay bushy. Nothing in a plain search tree makes that happen.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> A pub quiz where every question is "higher or lower". You get there in about twenty guesses out of a million, provided the person answering is picking sensible midpoints and not counting up from one.</p>`,

The structure is the search, which is why the code is a walk rather than arithmetic." },
    { t: "The rule is about whole subtrees, not about children", d: "Every value in the left subtree must be smaller than the node, not merely its immediate left child. This distinction is invisible in a diagram and fatal in code: the classic broken validator checks parent against child, passes happily, and accepts a tree where a grandchild sits on completely the wrong side." },
    { t: "So validating is a range problem", d: "Walk down carrying a permitted range. The root may be anything; going left tightens the upper bound to the node's value, going right tightens the lower bound. A node outside its inherited range is a violation. Once you see the rule as a range rather than a comparison, the correct check writes itself." },
    { t: "In-order traversal is the invariant read aloud", d: "Left, then node, then right, means smaller things, then this thing, then larger things, at every level. So an in-order walk emits the values in <b>sorted order</b>, and \"kth smallest\" is that walk with a counter and an early exit rather than anything cleverer." },
    { t: "Everything costs O(h), and h is a promise nobody made", d: "Search, insert and delete each follow one root-to-leaf path. On a bushy tree that is log n. Insert already-sorted data and every value goes right, producing a tree that is a linked list with extra pointers: <b>h = n</b>, and every operation degrades to O(n). Sorted input is not an exotic edge case, it is what most real data looks like on arrival." },

They are not a different idea, they are this idea with the promise actually kept.

  hing: `<p><b>Shuruaat yahan se karo:</b> binary search ke liye <b>sorted array</b> chahiye, taaki beech wala element turant mil jaaye. Par array mein beech mein kuch daalo to aadha array khisakna padta hai. <b>O(n)</b>.</p>
<p><b>Search tree ka idea:</b> halving rakho, khisakna hatao. Beech wali value ko root banao, chhoti sab left mein, badi sab right mein, aur yahi baat har node par dohrao. Ab dhoondhna wahi decisions hain jo binary search leta hai, bas woh decisions <b>pehle se tree ki shakal mein likhe hue hain</b>.</p>
<p><b>Sabse zaroori baat, aur yahin log galti karte hain:</b> niyam <b>poore subtree</b> par lagta hai, sirf bachche par nahi. Left subtree ka <b>har</b> element node se chhota hona chahiye, sirf uska left child nahi. Isiliye "isValidBST" ka galat solution itna common hai: woh sirf parent aur child compare karta hai, khush ho kar pass kar deta hai, aur ek galat jagah baithe grandchild ko nahi pakadta.</p>
<p><b>To validate kaise karein?</b> Range leke neeche jao. Root kuch bhi ho sakta hai. Left jaate waqt <b>upper limit</b> chhoti karo, right jaate waqt <b>lower limit</b> badi karo. Jo node apni range se bahar hai, wahi galat hai.</p>
<p><b>In-order traversal (left, node, right)</b> ka matlab hai: pehle chhote, phir yeh, phir bade. Isliye values <b>sorted</b> nikalti hain. Yeh koi ittefaq nahi, yeh wahi invariant hai bol kar sunaya gaya. "Kth smallest" bas isi walk mein ek counter lagana hai.</p>
<p><b>Ab woh baat jo sab bhool jaate hain:</b> har operation <b>O(h)</b> hai, O(log n) nahi. Agar data pehle se <b>sorted</b> aa gaya, to har value right mein jaayegi aur tree ek seedhi line ban jaayega. <b>h = n</b>, sab kuch O(n). Aur sorted data koi ajeeb edge case nahi hai, asli duniya mein data aksar aise hi aata hai.</p>
<p><b>Isiliye AVL aur red-black trees bane hain.</b> Woh koi naya idea nahi hain, bas yahi idea hai jisme rotations se height log n ke aas-paas rakhi jaati hai. Java ka <code>TreeMap</code> aur C++ ka <code>std::map</code> pehle se yahi hain.</p>
<p><b>Aur BST kab lena hai, hash map ke bajaye?</b> Sirf tab jab <b>order</b> chahiye: range query, floor/ceiling, next bada ya pichhla chhota, sorted iteration. Agar yeh kuch nahi chahiye, to hash map O(1) deta hai aur tum bina wajah log n de rahe ho.</p>`,

  plain: `<p>A hash set answers one question superbly: is this exact string present. Ask it anything softer, such as which stored words begin with "pre", and it has nothing to offer but a full scan, because hashing deliberately scrambles similar keys into unrelated slots. "cat" and "cats" are neighbours to you and strangers to the table.</p>
<p>A trie keeps the resemblance instead of destroying it. Each edge carries one character, each node is the prefix spelled by the path from the root, and any two words sharing a first few letters share those first few edges. "car", "cart" and "care" cost you c, a, r once between them.</p>
<p>So a lookup is: start at the root, follow one edge per character, and see whether you fall off the tree. That costs the length of the word and nothing else. A million stored words do not make it slower, because you only ever walk your own word.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> A filing system by street address rather than by name. Everyone on Baker Street is filed down the same corridor, so "who lives on Baker Street" is a walk to one cabinet, not a sweep of the building. The price is that you keep a corridor even for the streets with one resident.</p>`,

    { t: "Start from the question a hash set cannot answer",
      d: "A hash set tells you whether a word is present in O(1) and refuses everything else. Asking it for all words starting with \"pre\" means testing every stored word, O(total characters), because <b>hashing throws away the relationship between similar keys on purpose</b>. Good hashing spreads \"cat\" and \"cats\" as far apart as any two random strings." },
    { t: "If prefixes matter, store them once and share them",
      d: "The words in a dictionary overlap heavily at the front. Give each character its own edge and let words that agree so far travel the same edges. A node then <b>is</b> a prefix, spelled by the path that reached it, and nothing is stored twice at the front." },
    { t: "Now the prefix question is just a walk",
      d: "Follow one edge per character of the prefix. Arrive at a node and every word underneath it starts with that prefix, by construction. Fall off the tree and no stored word does. There is no searching anywhere in that sentence." },
    { t: "So cost depends on the word, not on the collection",
      d: "Insert, search and prefix check each touch <b>L nodes for a word of length L</b>. Ten words or ten million, the walk is the same length, because you never look at anyone else's letters. That, not raw speed, is the actual argument against a hash map." },
    { t: "Reaching a node is not the same as a word ending there",
      d: "Insert \"cat\" and you have created nodes for c, ca and cat. If arriving somewhere meant a hit, the trie would claim to contain \"ca\". So each node carries an <b>isEnd flag</b>, set only where a word actually stops. Search checks the flag; a prefix query does not, and that one difference is the whole API." },
    { t: "The honest cost is memory",
      d: "Every node needs a way to reach its children: a map keyed by character, or a fixed array of 26 pointers. The array is faster and wastes most of itself on sparse data, since a node with one child still pays for 26 slots. A trie buys prefix walks with space, and on short unrelated strings that is a bad trade." },
    { t: "Which decides when to use it",
      d: "Use it when prefixes are the question: autocomplete, counting words with a prefix, word search on a board where one walk tests many candidate words at once, or a <b>bit trie</b> where numbers are stored as their bits and maximum XOR becomes greedily walking to the opposite bit at each level. If you only ever ask about whole exact strings, a hash set is smaller, simpler and better." },

  hing: `<p><b>Sawal yeh hai:</b> hash set batata hai "yeh exact word hai ya nahi", O(1) mein. Par "kaunse words 'pre' se shuru hote hain" par woh bilkul bekaar hai. Kyun? Kyunki hashing <b>jaan bujh kar</b> similar keys ka rishta tod deta hai. "cat" aur "cats" tumhare liye padosi hain, hash table ke liye do ajnabi.</p>
<p><b>Trie ka idea:</b> rishta todo mat, <b>rishta hi structure bana do</b>. Har edge par ek character, aur jo words shuru mein match karte hain woh wahi edges share karte hain. Matlab har node khud ek <b>prefix</b> hai, jo root se us tak ka raasta bolta hai. "car", "cart", "care" ke liye c, a, r sirf ek baar bane.</p>
<p><b>Ab prefix ka sawaal search nahi, walk hai.</b> Prefix ke har character par ek edge chalo. Node mil gaya to uske neeche ke saare words us prefix se shuru hote hain, definition se. Edge nahi mila to koi word nahi hai. Bas.</p>
<p><b>Asli selling point (interview mein yahi bolo):</b> cost <b>O(L)</b> hai, L = word ki length, aur yeh <b>store kitne words hain uspar depend hi nahi karta</b>. 10 words ho ya 10 lakh, tum sirf apne word ke letters chalte ho. Hash map ki O(1) bhi asal mein key ko hash karti hai, yaani O(L) hi hai, par woh prefix ka jawab de hi nahi sakta.</p>
<p><b>isEnd flag kyun chahiye, yeh sabse zyada miss hota hai.</b> "cat" daala to c, ca, cat, teeno nodes ban gaye. Agar node par pahunchna hi "mil gaya" maana jaaye to trie kahega "ca" bhi present hai, jo galat hai. Isliye har node par <b>isEnd</b> rakho, sirf wahan true jahan koi word khatam hota hai. <code>search()</code> flag check karta hai, <code>startsWith()</code> nahi karta. Poora difference yahi ek line hai.</p>
<p><b>Kimat kya hai? Memory.</b> Har node ko children chahiye: ya to ek map, ya 26 pointers ka fixed array. Array tez hai par ek child wale node par bhi poore 26 slots ka kharcha deta hai, yaani sparse data par zyaadatar memory khaali padi rehti hai. Map memory bachata hai, thoda slow hai. Interview mein yeh trade-off khud bolo, achha lagta hai.</p>
<p><b>Kab lena hai:</b> autocomplete, prefix count, board par word search (ek DFS walk se kai words ek saath test ho jaate hain), aur <b>bit trie</b>, jahan numbers ko unke bits ke roop mein daalte ho aur maximum XOR nikalna bas har level par ulta bit chunne ki greedy walk ban jaata hai. <b>Kab nahi lena:</b> jab sirf poore exact strings poochhe jaayein.

  hing: `<p><b>Kahani wahin se shuru hoti hai jahan prefix sums khatam hote hain.</b> Prefix array mein query O(1) hai, par ek element badal do aur uske baad ke saare prefixes galat ho jaate hain, yaani update O(n). Plain array mein ulta hai: update O(1), query O(n). Dono <b>extreme</b> hain. Jab reads aur writes dono mile hue aayein, to wahi beech wala structure chahiye jo dono nahi deta.</p>
<p><b>Beech wala kaise banega?</b> Pehle sqrt decomposition socho: array ko blocks mein baanto, har block ka sum rakho. Query mein beech ke poore blocks + kinaare ke chhote elements, matlab n/b + b. b = sqrt(n) rakho to dono O(sqrt n). Idea yeh hai: <b>prefixes ke bajaye ranges par precompute karo</b>.</p>
<p><b>Segment tree bas isi ko recursive kar deta hai.</b> Ek fixed block size chunne ke bajaye range ko aadha aadha todte jao, single element tak. Ab har size ke blocks maujood hain, tree ki depth log2 n. Query karte waqt: jo node poori range ke andar hai, uski stored value le lo aur ruk jao; jo bilkul bahar hai, identity return karo; sirf woh nodes tode jaate hain jo endpoint par latke hain. Do endpoints, log n levels, isliye <b>O(log n)</b> nodes. Update mein sirf ek root-to-leaf path badalta hai, wapas aate waqt har parent ko dobara combine kar do.</p>
<p><b>Sabse important baat jo log interview mein miss karte hain:</b> is poore derivation mein kahin subtraction use nahi hua. Operation ko sirf <b>associative</b> hona chahiye. Isliye wahi tree sum, min, max, gcd, bitwise or, sab kar leta hai, bas <code>op</code> aur identity badalti hai. Yahi wajah hai ki itna code likhna sahi hai. Prefix array kabhi range minimum nahi de sakta, kyunki min ko "un-add" nahi kar sakte.</p>
<p><b>Fenwick tree (BIT) ka trick, dheere se padho:</b> <code>i &amp; -i</code> matlab i ka <b>sabse chhota set bit</b>, aur wahi bata deta hai ki node i kitne elements ka zimmedaar hai. Prefix nikalna hai to i mein se woh bit hatate jao aur values jodte jao. Update karna hai to wahi bit jodte jao aur upar chadhte jao.

<p>Two consequences follow immediately. First, there is no root, so "where do I start" becomes a real question and one traversal may not reach everything. Second, and much more importantly, <b>paths can loop</b>. In a tree you can walk forever without meeting yourself. In a graph you can, and you will, and your program will not stop.</p>
<p>Hence the visited set, which is not an optimisation. It is the thing keeping the program finite.</p>
<p>Once that is handled, traversal is almost anticlimactic. Take a node, look at its neighbours, add the unvisited ones to a container, repeat. Make the container a stack and you have depth-first search. Make it a queue and you have breadth-first search. That is the entire difference.</p>

  plain: `<p>BFS gets shortest paths right for a reason that is easy to miss: every edge costs exactly one, so the queue happens to hold nodes in order of distance already. The algorithm is not being clever, it is being handed the ordering for free.</p>
<p>Put a cost on each edge and that free ordering evaporates. A route of one expensive edge can cost more than a route of five cheap ones, so "fewest edges" and "cheapest" part company, and BFS confidently returns the wrong answer.</p>
<p>The repair is small in principle. Keep the best distance known so far for every node, always work on the <b>cheapest unfinished node</b>, and each time you do, check whether going through it improves any neighbour. That check is called relaxation and it is the entire algorithm. The priority queue exists solely to answer "which is cheapest" without rescanning everything.</p>
<p>There is one assumption hiding in there, and it is worth naming now: this only works if edges add cost. Allow a negative edge and a settled answer can turn out to be wrong later, which Dijkstra will never notice.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> Planning a drive by always extending the cheapest route you have so far. It works beautifully, right up until someone opens a road that pays you to drive down it.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "See why BFS worked, and the rest follows", d: "With unit edges, everything at distance 1 is discovered before anything at distance 2, so the queue is sorted by distance without anyone sorting it. Distance and edge count are the same number. Give edges different costs and those two quantities separate, and the queue's ordering becomes meaningless." },
    { t: "So restore the ordering by hand", d: "Keep a tentative best distance for every node, all infinite except the source. Repeatedly take the <b>cheapest unfinished node</b> and process it. That is the only structural change from BFS, and it is what a priority queue is for: BFS with a heap instead of a queue is Dijkstra." },
    { t: "Relaxation is the whole operation", d: "For each neighbour, ask whether <code>dist[u] + weight(u, v)</code> beats <code>dist[v]</code>. If it does, write down the better number. Nothing else happens. The algorithm is one comparison repeated until nothing improves." },
    { t: "Why a settled node is final, which is also the assumption", d: "When you pull the cheapest unfinished node u, every other unfinished node already costs at least as much. Any alternative route to u must pass through one of them, and since weights are non-negative, going further can only add cost. So no cheaper route can exist and u is done. <b>That argument is load-bearing, and it consumes the non-negativity as fuel.</b>" },
    { t: "Negative edges break the argument, not just the answer", d: "With a negative edge, going further can make a path cheaper, so a node you already settled might have been wrong. Dijkstra has no mechanism to revisit it and will not tell you. <b>Bellman-Ford</b> gives up the greedy shortcut and simply relaxes every edge V-1 times, which is O(V·E) and slower, but correct with negatives. A V-th pass that still improves something proves a negative cycle, at which point \"shortest path\" is not a well-posed question." },
    { t: "Pick the algorithm from the shape of the problem", d: "Unit weights: BFS, O(V + E), and do not reach for a heap out of habit. Non-negative weights: Dijkstra, O((V + E) log V). Negative weights: Bellman-Ford, O(V·E). Every pair of nodes on a small graph: Floyd-Warshall, three nested loops and O(V³), which is worth it only when V is a few hundred. Interviewers ask which one and why far more often than they ask you to type any of them." },
    { t: "A* is Dijkstra that has been told where it is going", d: "Dijkstra expands outward in every direction because it has no idea where the target is. Give it an estimate of remaining distance and let it prefer nodes that look closer to the goal, and it stops exploring the wrong half of the map. If that estimate never overstates the true remaining cost, the answer is still exactly correct." },

  plain: `<p>Traversal answers "are these two nodes connected?" perfectly well, once. Ask it a thousand times while edges are still arriving and it falls apart: every query is a fresh O(V + E) walk, and every new edge invalidates whatever you learned last time. The work is not being reused because there is nothing to reuse.</p>
<p>So change what you store. You do not actually need the edges to answer that question. You need to know, for each node, <b>which group it belongs to</b>. Give every group one member elected as its <b>representative</b>, and "are u and v connected?" becomes "do u and v report to the same representative?". Adding an edge no longer means recording a connection, it means merging two groups into one.</p>
<p>Everything else on this page is bookkeeping: how a node finds its representative, and how two groups are merged without the structure slowly turning into a linked list.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> Company mergers. Nobody keeps a list of who acquired whom; each employee just knows who they report to, and you follow that chain up until you hit someone who reports to no one. Two people are in the same company when the chain ends at the same CEO.</p>`,

The fix is to stop choosing the new root arbitrarily: <b>hang the smaller tree under the larger</b> (union by size, or by rank, which tracks depth instead).

  plain: `<p>Some problems do not ask for a path or a distance. They hand you a pile of things and a list of rules of the form "this one has to happen before that one", and ask for a sequence that breaks none of them. Compiling modules, installing packages, taking courses with prerequisites, recalculating a spreadsheet after one cell changes: all the same question.</p>
<p>Model each thing as a node and each rule as a directed edge pointing from the earlier thing to the later one. Now the question is: can I lay the nodes in a line so that every arrow points forwards? That line is a <b>topological order</b>.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is no such line. If A waits on B, B waits on C, and C waits on A, no arrangement can save you, and no algorithm can invent one. That is a <b>cycle</b>, and it is the only thing that can go wrong. So an algorithm that produces the order also, for free, answers "is this graph acyclic". The two questions are one computation, which is why so many interview problems that never say the words "topological sort" are exactly that.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> Getting dressed. Socks before shoes, shirt before jacket. Plenty of valid orders exist, nobody cares which one you pick, and if someone tells you the jacket goes before the shirt which goes before the jacket, you do not need to try harder, you need a different list of rules.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "Start from the rule, not from the algorithm", d: "You are given constraints of the shape \"u before v\". Draw each one as an arrow from u to v. Nothing else is given, and nothing else is needed: the whole problem is now \"arrange the nodes in a line with every arrow pointing right\"." },
    { t: "A cycle is the only obstruction, and it is total", d: "If a set of nodes forms a cycle, each of them needs another one to come first, so none can go first, so no valid line exists. And if there is no cycle, one always exists. So the order is possible <b>exactly when</b> the graph is a DAG, which makes sorting and cycle detection the same job wearing two names." },
    { t: "Which gives Kahn's algorithm almost without thinking", d: "Something has to go first, and only a node with no incoming edges can. Count incoming edges (the <b>in-degree</b>), queue everything at zero, and emit them. Removing a node satisfies the constraints it imposed, so decrement its neighbours' in-degrees and queue any that hit zero. Repeat." },
    { t: "And Kahn reports the cycle by counting", d: "If the graph is acyclic, every node eventually reaches in-degree zero and gets emitted. If you emit fewer than V nodes, the ones left over never reached zero, which means each is still waiting on another survivor. <b>The leftovers are precisely the nodes on or downstream of a cycle.</b> No extra pass, no extra bookkeeping, just a length check." },
    { t: "The DFS version is the same idea run backwards", d: "Walk depth-first, and push a node onto a list only <b>after</b> every node it points to is finished. So a node is recorded later than all of its dependents, and reversing the list puts it earlier than all of them. Equivalent output, different bookkeeping: this is the finish-time ordering." },
    { t: "DFS cycle detection needs three states, not a visited set", d: "A visited flag answers \"have I ever been here\". For a cycle you need \"am I here <i>right now</i>\": an edge into a node still on the current call stack is a cycle, an edge into a node already finished is just a shortcut into explored territory. So mark nodes unvisited, <b>in progress</b>, and done. Collapsing the last two into one flag reports cycles in a diamond that has none, and it is the single most common wrong answer on this topic." },
    { t: "What it cannot do, and one thing it gets cheaply", d: "It cannot give you <i>the</i> order, because there generally is not one: any two nodes with no path between them may go either way, and asking for the lexicographically smallest just means Kahn's queue becomes a min-heap. It also cannot tell you <i>which</i> nodes form the cycle unless you look, only that one exists. What it does hand you free: with the nodes in topological order you can relax edges in one forward sweep and get shortest paths on a DAG in O(V + E), negative weights included, which Dijkstra cannot manage. That is the shortest paths page's business, but the order comes from here." },

  hing: `<p><b>Sawaal kya hai:</b> kuch kaam hain aur rules hain "yeh usse pehle hona chahiye". Har cheez ko node banao, har rule ko <b>arrow</b> banao jo pehle wale se baad wale ki taraf jaaye. Ab bas ek line mein sabko lagana hai jisme saare arrows aage ki taraf point karein. Wahi <b>topological order</b> hai. Build steps, course prerequisites, spreadsheet recalculation, sab yahi hai.</p>
<p><b>Sirf ek cheez galat ho sakti hai: cycle.</b> A ko B chahiye, B ko C, C ko A. Ab koi pehla ho hi nahi sakta. Aur agar cycle nahi hai to order hamesha milega. Matlab <b>order exist karta hai sirf aur sirf tab jab graph DAG ho</b>. Isliye topological sort aur cycle detection <b>ek hi computation</b> hai. Interview mein aadhe sawaal cycle detection hi hote hain, bas naam badla hua hota hai. Yeh line yaad rakho.</p>
<p><b>Kahn ka tarika (BFS jaisa):</b> har node ke <b>in-degree</b> gino, matlab kitne log uska raasta rok rahe hain. Jinka in-degree 0 hai unhe queue mein daalo, kyunki unhe koi rok nahi raha. Ek node nikaalo, output mein daalo, aur uske padosiyon ka in-degree 1 kam kar do (uski shart poori ho gayi). Jiska 0 hua, woh queue mein. Bas.</p>
<p><b>Kahn cycle bhi muft mein bata deta hai:</b> agar output mein V se <b>kam</b> nodes aaye, to jo bache woh kabhi 0 tak pahunche hi nahi, matlab woh aapas mein ek doosre ka intezaar kar rahe hain. <b>Bache hue nodes hi cycle hain (ya uske peeche latke hue hain).</b> Sirf ek length check, koi extra pass nahi. Isiliye interview mein Kahn se shuru karo, samjhaana aasan hai.</p>
<p><b>DFS wala tarika ulta chalta hai:</b> node ko list mein tab daalo jab uske saare descendants khatam ho jaayein, phir list ko <b>reverse</b> kar do. Kyunki node baad mein likha gaya, reverse karne par sabse pehle aa jaayega.</p>
<p><b>Ab sabse zaroori part, jahan log maar khaate hain.</b> DFS mein cycle dhoondhne ke liye plain <code>visited</code> set <b>kaafi nahi hai</b>. Visited ka matlab hai "kabhi gaya tha". Cycle ke liye chahiye "<b>abhi is waqt isi raaste par hoon kya</b>". Isliye teen states rakho: <b>unvisited</b>, <b>in progress</b> (abhi call stack par hai), aur <b>done</b>. In-progress node par edge mila to cycle. Done node par edge mila to kuch nahi, woh sirf pehle explore kiya hua hissa hai. Do states mein daba diya to diamond shape (A se B aur C, dono se D) par jhoothi cycle report hogi, jahan cycle hai hi nahi. <b>Yeh is topic ka sabse common galat jawaab hai.</b></p>
<p><b>Order unique nahi hota.</b> Jin do nodes ke beech koi raasta hi nahi, unka aage-peeche kuch bhi ho sakta hai. Agar <b>lexicographically smallest</b> maanga hai to bas Kahn ki queue ki jagah <b>min-heap</b> laga do, baaki sab wahi. Cost O(V + E) se O(V log V + E) ho jaati hai.</p>
<p><b>Ek bonus:</b> DAG par nodes ko topological order mein leke edges relax kar do, to shortest paths <b>O(V + E)</b> mein mil jaate hain, <b>negative weights ke saath bhi</b>, jo Dijkstra nahi kar sakta. Uski detail shortest paths wale page par hai, par order yahin se aata hai.</p>`,

  one: "Connect every node as cheaply as possible: exactly V-1 edges, no cycles. Both algorithms are one greedy rule, <b>the lightest edge crossing any cut is safe</b>.",

  plain: `<p>You have a weighted, undirected graph and a bill to pay. Every node has to end up connected to every other one, and you would like the total weight of the edges you keep to be as small as possible. Nothing else matters: not how far apart two nodes end up, not which node you started from.</p>
<p>That last sentence is the one people skip. It sounds like the tree you build should also give you good routes between nodes, and it does not. <b>Cheapest overall</b> and <b>closest to a source</b> are two different requests, and the answers to them are two different trees. This page spends real time on that, because interviewers do too.</p>
<p>The structure of the answer is forced. V nodes need at least V-1 edges to be connected, and any extra edge creates a cycle you could have saved money on. So the answer is a tree, and the only question left is which V-1 edges. Both classic algorithms answer it with the same greedy step applied from different directions: Kruskal sorts the edges and takes them cheapest first, Prim grows one tree and always eats the cheapest edge leaving it.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> Laying cable between towns. You are paying for cable, not for driving time. The cheapest network to build is not the network with the fastest route between any two towns, and a resident who cares about their commute will not thank you for the difference.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "The shape of the answer is forced before you choose anything",
      d: "V nodes cannot be connected by fewer than V-1 edges. Add one more and you have closed a cycle, and on a cycle you can always delete the heaviest edge: every node is still reachable, going the other way round, and the bill just went down. So an optimal answer has <b>no cycles and exactly V-1 edges</b>, which is the definition of a tree. The word tree here is a conclusion, not a starting assumption." },

    { t: "It is not a shortest path tree, and this is where the question is lost",
      d: "Three nodes: A-B costs 2, B-C costs 2, A-C costs 3. The MST keeps the two 2s for a total of 4, because every other spanning tree costs 5. Now walk from A to C inside that tree: 4. The true shortest path is the single edge of weight 3, which the MST deliberately threw away. <b>Minimising the sum is a different objective from minimising each individual distance from a source.</b> A shortest path tree from A would keep the 3 and cost more in total. Neither tree is wrong; they answer different questions." },

    { t: "The cut property is the one fact both algorithms stand on",
      d: "Split the nodes into two non-empty sides, any split at all. Look at the edges with one end on each side. <b>The lightest of those crossing edges belongs to some minimum spanning tree.</b> Note the phrasing borrowed from the greedy page: some, not every. One safe optimal solution containing it is all the argument needs." },

    { t: "Prove it with the exchange argument, nothing new required",
      d: "Let e be the lightest edge crossing the cut and let T be any MST that does not contain e. Add e to T and you create exactly one cycle. That cycle leaves one side of the cut and has to come back, so it uses a second crossing edge f, and by choice of e, <code>weight(f) >= weight(e)</code>. Drop f. What is left is still spanning, still a tree, and <b>no heavier</b> than T. So an MST containing e exists. As on the greedy page, you never argue that greedy beats the optimum, only that it ties." },

    { t: "Kruskal falls out: sort, then ask which component",
      d: "Take the edges cheapest first. When you reach an edge whose two ends are in different components, consider the cut that separates those two components: nothing lighter crosses it, because anything lighter has already been processed and would have merged them. So the edge is safe by the cut property. If the ends are already in the same component, the edge closes a cycle and is dropped. That component test is exactly <b>union-find</b>, which has its own page, and the total is <b>O(E log E)</b> with the sort paying nearly all of it." },

    { t: "Prim falls out: fix one side of the cut and never move it",
      d: "Start from any node and let the cut always be (what I have built, everything else). The cheapest edge crossing it is safe, so take it, absorb the node on the far end, and repeat. A <b>priority queue</b> of edges leaving the tree answers cheapest quickly, giving <b>O(E log V)</b>. This is Dijkstra's loop, line for line, with one difference worth memorising: <b>Dijkstra keys the queue by the distance from the source, <code>dist[u] + w</code>. Prim keys it by <code>w</code>, the weight of the single edge into the tree.</b> One addition, deleted. That is the entire difference, and it is also why one gives shortest paths and the other does not." },

Prim for <b>dense</b> graphs and whenever the graph is handed to you as an adjacency structure, and on a truly dense graph drop the heap for an O(V²) scan. Also: the MST is <b>not unique</b> when weights tie, so two correct programs can return different trees, but the <b>multiset of weights is the same</b> in every MST, which is why the total is safe to compare and the edge list is not. And all of this assumes an <b>undirected connected</b> graph. Directed edges make it a different problem with a different algorithm, and a disconnected graph has no spanning tree at all, only a spanning forest." },

  plain: `<p>Sorting looks like a solved problem you should simply call a library for, and mostly it is. What matters in an interview is knowing <i>why</i> the library stops where it does, and when you are allowed to go faster.</p>
<p>Here is the surprising part. Arranging n items means picking one arrangement out of <b>n factorial</b> possibilities. Each comparison you make has two outcomes, so it can at best halve the field. To narrow n! possibilities down to one you therefore need about <b>log₂(n!) ≈ n log n</b> comparisons, no matter how clever the algorithm is.</p>
<p>So merge sort and heap sort are not merely good; they are <b>optimal</b> for comparison sorting. And the only way past the barrier is to stop comparing: if you can use the values themselves as array positions, the argument no longer applies.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> Twenty questions. Each yes-or-no answer halves the possibilities, so twenty questions can distinguish about a million things, and no fewer questions will do, however well you choose them.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "Count what has to be decided", d: "There are <b>n!</b> possible orderings and only one is correct. A comparison returns one of two answers, so it can at best cut the surviving possibilities in half. You need enough comparisons k that 2<sup>k</sup> ≥ n!, which gives k ≥ log₂(n!) ≈ <b>n log n</b>. This is a lower bound on the problem, not on any particular algorithm." },
    { t: "Merge sort meets the bound exactly", d: "Split in half repeatedly. That is <b>log n levels</b>. Merging two already-sorted runs is a single walk with two fingers, <b>O(n) per level</b>. Multiply: O(n log n), guaranteed, worst case included. It is also <b>stable</b>, and it pays O(n) scratch memory for both properties." },
    { t: "Quicksort meets it on average, with no extra memory", d: "Pick a pivot, partition so that smaller values sit left and larger right, recurse on each side. A good pivot halves the array and gives O(n log n) in O(1) extra space. A bad pivot peels off one element at a time and gives <b>O(n²)</b>, which is why real implementations randomise the pivot, or count their recursion depth and switch to heap sort." },
    { t: "What your standard library actually runs", d: "Rarely a textbook algorithm. <b>Timsort</b> (Python, and Java for objects) hunts for runs that are already ordered and merges those, so nearly-sorted input costs <b>O(n)</b>. <b>Introsort</b> (C++) is quicksort that falls back to heap sort when the recursion gets too deep, so it keeps the O(1) space without the O(n²) risk." },
    { t: "The bound only binds comparison sorts", d: "The whole proof assumed information arrives one comparison at a time. Counting sort makes no comparisons: it uses each value as an <b>index</b> into a tally array, then reads the tallies back out. That is <b>O(n + k)</b> for k distinct values, genuinely linear, and only worth it when k is small relative to n. Radix sort applies the same trick digit by digit." },
    { t: "Stability is not a detail", d: "A stable sort keeps equal elements in their original relative order. That is what allows multi-key sorting: sort by the secondary key, then by the primary, and the secondary ordering survives inside each group. If your language's sort is unstable, that technique silently produces wrong answers." },
    { t: "And sometimes you should not sort at all", d: "Sorting to find the k largest is O(n log n) when a size-k heap does it in O(n log k). Sorting to check for duplicates is O(n log n) when a hash set does it in O(n). Sorting is worth it when you need the <i>order</i> itself, or when order unlocks a two-pointer or binary-search technique." },

  plain: `<p>Three steps, always the same three. Divide the problem into smaller versions of itself, conquer those by recursion, then combine their answers into the answer you were asked for.</p>
<p>The first two steps are almost never interesting. Splitting an array in half takes no thought. What distinguishes one divide-and-conquer algorithm from another is entirely the third step, and the cost of the whole thing is usually the cost of combining, repeated once per level.</p>
<p>Merge sort splits trivially and does its real work merging. Quicksort is the mirror image: it does the work up front partitioning, and its combine step is literally nothing, because the pieces are already in the right places. Same shape, opposite distribution of effort.</p>
<p>And the reason it pays is that halving gives you only <b>log n</b> levels. Doing O(n) work on each of log n levels is O(n log n), which is a completely different animal from doing O(n) work n times.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> Counting a stadium crowd. You do not count 40,000 people. You split the stands into sections, hand each to somebody, and add up what they report. The addition is the only part you personally do, and it is the only part worth thinking about.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "The combine step is the algorithm", d: "Dividing is usually a midpoint calculation and conquering is a recursive call. Neither requires insight. Merge sort's merge, quickselect's decision about which side to recurse into, the counting of cross-pairs when counting inversions: <b>that</b> is where the thinking lives, and it is also where the cost usually lives." },
    { t: "Cost is levels multiplied by work per level", d: "Draw the recursion tree. Halving gives <b>log n</b> levels. If every level does O(n) total work, you get O(n log n). If the work shrinks geometrically down the levels, the top dominates and the total is just O(n). If it grows, the leaves dominate. You almost never need more machinery than looking at the tree and asking which end is heavier." },
    { t: "The master theorem is that observation, formalised", d: "For <code>T(n) = a·T(n/b) + f(n)</code>, compare the work at the top, <code>f(n)</code>, against the work at the leaves, <code>n^(log_b a)</code>. Whichever is bigger wins; if they match, you pay an extra log factor. Merge sort is a=2, b=2, f(n)=n, the two sides tie, and out comes n log n. Quote it, but read the tree first, because the tree is what you can reconstruct under pressure." },
    { t: "Recursing into one side only changes the class", d: "Binary search splits and then recurses into <b>one</b> half, so the levels do O(1) work each and the total is O(log n). Quickselect does the same trick with partitioning: it only recurses into the side containing the rank it wants, so the work halves each time and the whole thing averages <b>O(n)</b> rather than O(n log n). Sorting to find the kth element is throwing away that saving." },
    { t: "It is not a sorting technique, it is a shape", d: "Counting inversions is merge sort with a counter in the merge. Closest pair of points is a split by x with a clever strip check when combining. Fast exponentiation halves the exponent. Karatsuba multiplication and Strassen's matrix multiplication both beat the obvious algorithm purely by rearranging what gets combined. The shape transfers; the combine step is bespoke each time." },
    { t: "It ends where the subproblems start to overlap", d: "Divide and conquer assumes the pieces are <b>independent</b>. The moment two branches ask the same question, you are recomputing, and the fix is to cache, which makes it dynamic programming. That independence is also why divide and conquer parallelises almost for free while DP largely does not: no branch is waiting on another." },

  plain: `<p>Some questions do not want the best answer, they want <i>all</i> the answers: every subset, every permutation, every way to place eight queens. There is no clever formula waiting to be found. You have to look at the candidates, and backtracking is the tidy way to look at all of them exactly once.</p>
<p>The idea is to build an answer one decision at a time. Pick a first element, then a second, and keep going until you either have a complete answer or you hit a rule that says this cannot work. Then step back one decision and try the next option instead.</p>
<p>Stepping back is the whole trick, and it is literal: you <b>put the choice back</b> before trying the next one. One list is reused for the entire search, borrowed on the way down and returned on the way up. If you skip the return, the next branch starts wearing the last branch's clothes.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> A maze with chalk. At each junction you take a corridor and chalk a mark. Dead end? Walk back and <b>rub the mark out</b>, then take the next corridor. The chalk is your path, and rubbing out is the un-choose. Nobody ever solved a maze by leaving every wrong turn marked.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "The question asks for all of them",
      d: "\"Find one shortest path\" has room for cleverness. \"List every valid arrangement\" does not: if there are a million answers, you are printing a million answers. So the only sensible goal is to visit each candidate <b>once</b>, and never to visit a candidate that was doomed from the start." },
    { t: "Build the answer one decision at a time",
      d: "Do not think about finished answers, think about <b>partial</b> ones. An empty list, then a list of one, then two. Every partial answer is a node, every choice you could add next is an edge, and the whole search space is a tree you never build in memory. Backtracking is just DFS on that tree, and the <code>recursion</code> concept already covers the DFS half." },
    { t: "Choose, recurse, un-choose, and the undo is not optional",
      d: "Going down the tree means appending your choice to the path. Coming back up means <b>popping it off again</b>. The path is one shared mutable object, so if a branch does not clean up, its sibling starts with leftovers and produces answers that were never valid. Every <code>push</code> needs its <code>pop</code> on <b>every</b> exit route, including the early return." },
    { t: "Record a copy, not the path itself",
      d: "When you reach a complete answer, the obvious line stores the path. The path then keeps mutating for the rest of the search, and since your results list only holds a reference, all of them mutate with it. You end up with N copies of the same empty list, which is at least consistent. Store <code>path[:]</code>, a snapshot." },
    { t: "Duplicates in the input are handled at the level, not at the end",
      d: "Given <code>[1, 2, 2]</code>, two different branches produce the same subset. De-duplicating the results afterwards works and is slow. Instead <b>sort the input</b> so equal values are neighbours, then inside the loop skip a value equal to the previous one <i>at the same level</i>. Equal values stacked on top of each other (ancestor and descendant) are fine, that is how <code>[2, 2]</code> gets built. Only equal <b>siblings</b> are the duplicate." },
    { t: "The cost is the size of the tree, and pruning is the only lever",
      d: "There are 2^n subsets and n! permutations. No implementation trick changes that, because the output is that big. What you <i>can</i> change is how much of the tree is doomed and still explored. Rejecting a choice at depth 3 removes the entire subtree beneath it, so a check that costs O(1) can delete millions of nodes. That is why N-Queens is tractable and brute force is not: same tree, one of them stops early." },
    { t: "If the same state is reachable by many paths, you wanted DP",
      d: "Backtracking assumes each node is a <b>distinct</b> partial answer worth exploring. When different decision orders land on the same state, and you only care about a count or a best value rather than the arrangements themselves, you are re-solving identical subproblems and the answer is memoisation. The tell: your recursion's state is small (an index and a remaining sum) but the tree is exponential." },

  hing: `<p><b>Sabse pehle:</b> backtracking koi naya algorithm nahi hai, yeh <b>recursion + undo</b> hai. Ek decision tree par DFS, aur woh tree kabhi banate nahi, sirf uspar chalte hain.</p>
<p><b>Skeleton teen line ka hai:</b> <code>choose</code>, <code>recurse</code>, <code>un-choose</code>. Aur teesri line hi asli hai. Path ek hi list hai jo poore search mein share hoti hai. Agar tumne pop nahi kiya, to agli branch pichhli branch ka kachra leke shuru hogi, aur output mein aise answers aayenge jo kabhi valid the hi nahi. Rule: har <code>push</code> ka <code>pop</code>, <b>har</b> exit path par, early return waale par bhi.</p>
<p><b>Doosri classic galti:</b> <code>res.append(path)</code>. Yeh path ka <b>reference</b> store karta hai, aur path aage badalta rehta hai, to saare results ek saath badalte hain. Ant mein tumhare paas N khaali lists hoti hain. Hamesha <b>copy</b> daalo: Python <code>path[:]</code>, Java <code>new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(path)</code>, JS <code>[...path]</code>. C++ mein <code>push_back(path)</code> khud copy kar leta hai, wahan ulta problem hai: galti se poori vector by value pass kar doge.</p>
<p><b>Duplicates ka funda saaf samajh lo.</b> Input mein <code>[1,2,2]</code> hai to do alag branches same subset bana dengi. Pehle <b>sort</b> karo taaki equal values paas-paas aa jaayein, phir loop ke andar: <code>if (j &gt; i && nums[j] == nums[j-1]) continue;</code>. Dhyaan do, yeh sirf <b>same level ke siblings</b> ko skip karta hai. Ek 2 ke upar doosra 2 rakhna bilkul allowed hai, warna <code>[2,2]</code> banega hi nahi. Yeh distinction interview mein poocha jaata hai.</p>
<p><b>Complexity ka jawaab bina jhijhak do:</b> subsets O(2^n), permutations O(n!), aur har answer copy karne ka O(n) alag se. Interviewer "optimise karo" bole to yaad rakho: output hi itna bada hai, isliye asymptotic class nahi badlegi. Sirf ek cheez asli lever hai, <b>pruning</b>. Depth 3 par ek choice reject karna matlab uske neeche ka poora subtree gaya. Isiliye N-Queens chal jaata hai: same tree, bas jaldi ruk jaata hai.</p>
<p><b>Aur last, sabse zyada marks wali baat:</b> agar alag-alag decision order se <b>same state</b> par pahunch rahe ho, aur tumhein arrangements nahi balki sirf count ya best value chahiye, to yeh backtracking ka kaam hai hi nahi. Wahan subproblems overlap kar rahe hain, aur jawaab <b>DP</b> hai. Pehchaan simple hai: state chhoti hai (ek index aur ek remaining sum), par tree exponential hai. Yeh line interview mein bol dena, kaafi log yahin fisalte hain.</p>`,

<p>There are two directions to fill the same table. Write the recursion and add a cache (<b>top-down</b>), or work out the order in which values become available and fill them yourself (<b>bottom-up</b>). Same numbers, same table, opposite direction of travel.</p>

Isse <code>l = 0</code> wala case <b>special case rehta hi nahi</b>. Identity yaad rakho: <code>sum(l..r) = pre[r+1] - pre[l]</code>. Jitne bhi off by one bugs is pattern mein hote hain, sab yahin se aate hain. Pehle identity bolo, phir code likho.</p>
<p><b>Sabse important part, hash map wala counting trick:</b> "kitne subarrays ka sum k hai" poocha gaya. Seedha likho: <code>pre[r+1] - pre[l] = k</code>, ise ghumao to <code>pre[l] = pre[r+1] - k</code>. Matlab har position par sirf yeh poochna hai: <b>itni value wale kitne purane prefix dekhe hain?</b> Ek map rakho jisme har prefix sum ki count ho, ek hi pass mein kaam khatam. <b>O(n)</b>.</p>
<p><b>Map ko <code>{0: 1}</code> se seed karna mat bhoolna.</b> Woh ek entry khaali prefix hai. Uske bina woh saare subarrays chhoot jaate hain jo index 0 se shuru hote hain, aur test case 3 par silently galat answer aata hai.</p>
<p><b>Sliding window ya prefix sums, kaunsa?</b> Sliding window tab chalta hai jab sab numbers <b>positive</b> hon, kyunki tabhi window badhne se sum badhta hai (monotonic). Negative numbers aate hi woh assumption toot jaata hai. Prefix sums + hash map ko monotonicity chahiye hi nahi, isliye negatives ke saath wahi sahi tool hai. Doosri taraf, agar longest ya shortest window with a condition chahiye aur sab positive hai, to sliding window O(1) space mein kaam kar deta hai jabki prefix sums O(n) memory maangta hai. Constraints padho, phir choose karo.</p>
<p><b>2-D version (integral image):</b> grid mein har rectangle ka sum 4 lookups mein. Formula mein do rectangles jodo aur jo corner do baar gin liya use ghatao, yeh inclusion exclusion hai. Sign galat likhna sabse aam galti hai, ek chhoti 2x2 grid par haath se verify kar lo.</p>
<p><b>Difference array, ulta khel:</b> yahan bahut saare <b>range updates</b> hain aur padhna sirf end mein hai. <code>d[l] += v</code>, <code>d[r+1] -= v</code>, har update O(1), aur last mein ek prefix sum pass se poora array wapas. Array n+1 size ka rakho warna <code>r = n-1</code> par index out of bounds.</p>
<p><b>Aur agar array beech mein badalta rahe?</b> Tab prefix sums mar jaata hai, ek update poore tail ko invalid kar deta hai. Wahan <b>Fenwick tree ya segment tree</b> chahiye, O(log n) per update aur per query. Interview mein itna bol dena kaafi hai.</p>`,

  plain: `<p>The problem always has the same shape: <b>for each element, find the next element to its right that is bigger</b> (or smaller, or the nearest one to its left). Days until a warmer day. The next larger stock price. How far a bar in a histogram can stretch before a shorter bar stops it.</p>
<p>The obvious solution walks right from every position until it finds the answer, O(n²), and it re-reads the same tail over and over. The waste is not the scanning, it is that the scan keeps considering elements that <b>cannot possibly be the answer for anybody</b>.</p>
<p>Here is why. Suppose <code>b</code> sits after <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> is bigger. Then <code>a</code> is finished: for every position further right, <code>b</code> stands in the way and <code>b</code> is the better answer anyway. So <code>a</code> can be thrown away the moment <code>b</code> arrives, permanently. Keep only the elements nothing has blocked yet, and that leftover pile is automatically in decreasing order. Nobody sorted it. The discarding did.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> A queue of people waiting, seen from the back. Once someone taller joins behind you, nobody further back will ever see you again. The people still visible from the back of the line are always in decreasing height, and no one had to arrange them.</p>`,

<p><b>Asli insight (yahi poora topic hai):</b> agar <code>b</code>, <code>a</code> ke baad aaya aur <code>b</code> bada hai, to <code>a</code> ab <b>kisi ka bhi</b> next greater nahi ban sakta. Kyun? Kyunki aage waale har element ke liye <code>b</code> raaste mein khada hai, aur <code>b</code> behtar candidate bhi hai. Matlab <code>a</code> ko baad ke liye rakhna nahi hai, <b>hamesha ke liye phenk dena hai</b>. Stack mein sirf woh log bachte hain jinhe abhi tak kisi ne block nahi kiya, aur isiliye stack apne aap <b>decreasing order</b> mein rehta hai. Kisi ne sort nahi kiya, phenkne se apne aap ho gaya.</p>
<p><b>Answer kahaan se aata hai?</b> Jab naya <code>x</code> aata hai aur tum chhote elements pop kar rahe ho, to <code>x</code> hi un sab ka answer hai. Pop karte waqt likh do, bas. Ek hi pass mein poora answer array bhar jaata hai.</p>
<p><b>Interview ka sabse zaroori line:</b> "do loops hain to O(n²) hoga na?" Nahi. <b>Har index ek baar push hota hai aur zyada se zyada ek baar pop</b>. Isliye inner while poore program mein milakar n baar se zyada nahi chalta, har iteration mein n baar nahi. Total ~2n operations, <b>O(n)</b>. Yeh line bolna zaroori hai, sirf "amortised" keh dene se baat nahi banti.</p>
<p><b>Chaar directions, sirf do knobs:</b><br>next = left se right scan, previous = right se left scan.<br>greater = jab tak top chhota hai pop karo, smaller = jab tak top bada hai pop karo.<br>Aur <b>indices store karo, values nahi</b>, kyunki zyadatar sawaal distance poochhte hain (kitne din baad), aur index se value bhi mil jaati hai.</p>
<p><b>Ties ka trap:</b> equal elements par pop karoge ya chhod doge, yeh decide karta hai ki answer "strictly greater" hai ya "greater ya equal". Daily Temperatures mein <b>strictly warmer</b> chahiye, to equal ko pop mat karo.</p>
<p><b>Deque kab chahiye (sliding-window page ne yeh naam liya tha, samjhaya nahi tha):</b> window maximum mein current max <b>window ke aage se</b> bahar nikal jaata hai, jabki woh abhi bhi sabse bada hai. Stack us end tak pahunch hi nahi sakta, kyunki stack sirf ek hi taraf se nikaalta hai. Isliye <b>deque</b>: peeche se chhote elements pop karo (woh chhote bhi hain aur purane bhi, do baar mare hue), aage se woh index nikaalo jo window se bahar ho gaya. Front hamesha window ka maximum hota hai.</p>
<p><b>Largest Rectangle ka sentinel trick:</b> loop khatam hone ke baad stack mein kuch elements bache reh jaate hain jinka rectangle abhi nikala hi nahi gaya. Isliye aakhir mein ek <b>0 height</b> ka fake bar lagao. Woh sabse chhota hai, to sab kuch pop ho jaayega, aur alag se drain karne wala loop likhne ki zaroorat nahi padegi.</p>`,

  group: "Patterns",
  one: "Sorting is the algorithm, and the <b>sort key</b> is the decision: by start to merge, by end to pack the most. Then turn intervals into <b>+1/-1 events</b> and sweep.",

  plain: `<p>An interval is just a pair, a start and an end: a meeting, a booking, a range of house numbers. The questions are always the same three. Which ones overlap? How few can I keep so that none overlap? How many are happening at once at the busiest moment?</p>
<p>Handed an unsorted pile, you have no choice but to compare every interval with every other one, O(n squared), and you will still get the overlap test slightly wrong. Sorted, the picture changes completely: once intervals are in order, <b>only the neighbour matters</b>, and one left-to-right pass answers the question. The sort costs O(n log n) and buys the whole algorithm.</p>
<p>Which is why the only real decision on these problems is <b>what to sort by</b>. Sort by start when you are gluing overlapping things together. Sort by end when you are packing as many as possible into a day. Different key, different answer, same four lines of loop.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> A doorman with a clicker. He does not track who is inside or how long they stay. He clicks up when someone walks in, down when someone walks out, and the highest number he ever sees is the size of room the fire officer will insist on.</p>`,

  why: [
    { t: "Unsorted, every pair is a candidate",
      d: "With no order at all, the interval that overlaps the first one could be anywhere in the list, so you compare all n squared over two pairs. Nothing about the data stops you, which is exactly the problem: there is no local structure to exploit yet." },
    { t: "Get the overlap test right by negating the misses",
      d: "Do not enumerate the ways two intervals can overlap, there are four and you will forget one. Enumerate the two ways they can <b>miss</b>: <code>b &lt; c</code> (the first ends before the second starts) or <code>d &lt; a</code> (the other way round). Negate both and you are done: <code>[a,b]</code> and <code>[c,d]</code> overlap when <b><code>a &lt;= d and c &lt;= b</code></b>. Two comparisons, no cases." },
    { t: "Sorting by start makes the neighbour the only thing that matters",
      d: "Once starts are in order, every interval that could overlap the current one has already been seen. So walk the list holding the block you are building: if the next start is at or before the block's end, <b>extend the end</b>, otherwise there is a real gap and you start a new block. One pass, and the total is O(n log n) because the sort dominates." },
    { t: "A different question wants a different key",
      d: "Now ask for the largest set of intervals that do not overlap. Sorting by start is useless here, a first meeting that runs all day blocks everything. Sort by <b>end</b>: the one that finishes earliest leaves the most room for whatever follows, and greedily taking each interval that starts after the last kept end is optimal. Same shape of loop, different key, and the key is the entire argument." },
    { t: "Now stop thinking about intervals and think about events",
      d: "For counting questions the pairing is a distraction. Split each interval into two things that happen on a number line: <b>+1 at the start</b>, <b>-1 at the end</b>. Sort all 2n of them by position and sweep left to right with a running counter. That counter is how many intervals are live at your current position, and its maximum is the peak concurrency: meeting rooms, overlapping bookings, the height in a skyline." },
    { t: "At equal positions, the tie rule decides what overlap means",
      d: "One meeting ends at 10:00 and another starts at 10:00. Process the <b>-1 before the +1</b> and they do not clash, so one room is enough. Process the +1 first and you have invented a second room. Neither is wrong in general, it depends on whether touching counts as overlapping, but it must be a decision and not an accident of your comparator." },
    { t: "What the sweep will not give you",
      d: "It reports numbers, not memberships: you learn that four things overlap at position 12, not <i>which</i> four, unless you carry an active set alongside the counter and pay for it. It is also <b>offline</b>, you need every interval before you can sort. Intervals arriving one at a time, with queries in between, is a different problem and wants an interval tree or an ordered map." },

  hing: `<p><b>Ek line mein:</b> interval problems mein asli algorithm <b>sort</b> hai. Loop to char line ka hai. Poora dimaag sirf ek sawaal par lagao: <b>kis cheez se sort karun, start se ya end se?</b></p>
<p><b>Pehle overlap test, kyunki yahin sabse zyada log phisalte hain.</b> Overlap ke saare cases mat ginno, char hote hain aur ek zaroor bhool jaaoge. Ulta socho: do interval <b>miss</b> kaise karte hain? Sirf do tareeke, <code>b &lt; c</code> ya <code>d &lt; a</code>. Ab dono ko negate kar do: <code>[a,b]</code> aur <code>[c,d]</code> overlap karte hain jab <b><code>a &lt;= d and c &lt;= b</code></b>. Bas do comparison, koi case analysis nahi. Yeh line yaad rakh lo, interview mein seedha likh dena.</p>
<p><b>Start se sort kyun merge ke liye?</b> Jab starts sorted hain, to jo bhi interval current wale se overlap kar sakta tha woh <b>pehle hi dekha ja chuka hai</b>. Isliye sirf apne aakhri block ko pakde raho: agla start block ke end tak ya usse pehle hai to end ko <code>max</code> se badha do, warna asli gap hai, naya block shuru. Ek pass. <code>max</code> lagana mat bhoolna, warna ek chhota interval jo poora andar hi samaya hua tha, tumhara block chhota kar dega.</p>
<p><b>End se sort kab?</b> Jab sawaal ho "zyada se zyada kitne non-overlapping rakh sakte ho". Yahan start se sort karna bekaar hai, ek subah shuru hone wali din bhar chalne wali meeting sab kuch block kar degi. <b>Jo sabse pehle khatam hota hai</b> woh baaki sabke liye sabse zyada jagah chhodta hai. Yahi exchange argument hai, aur yahi jawaab interviewer sun-na chahta hai.</p>
<p><b>Ab asli cheez, sweep line.</b> Interval ke baare mein sochna band karo, <b>events</b> ke baare mein socho. Har interval ko do events mein tod do: start par <b>+1</b>, end par <b>-1</b>. Saare 2n events ko position se sort karo aur left se right chalte hue ek counter chalao. Woh counter batata hai ki is waqt kitni cheezein <b>live</b> hain. Uska maximum hi tumhara jawaab hai: kitne meeting rooms chahiye, kitni cars ek saath, skyline ki height. Ek loop, teen alag alag problems.</p>
<p><b>Tie ka rule, ise halke mein mat lo.</b> Ek meeting 10:00 par khatam, doosri 10:00 par shuru. Agar <b>-1 pehle</b> process kiya to dono ek hi room mein aa jaayengi. Agar +1 pehle kiya to tumne bina zaroorat ke ek extra room bana diya. Dono sahi ho sakte hain, depend karta hai ki chhoote hue kinare overlap maane jaayenge ya nahi. Par yeh <b>decision</b> hona chahiye, comparator ki galti nahi.</p>
<p><b>Heap wala tareeka bhi jaan lo.</b> Start se sort karo, aur ek min-heap rakho jisme rooms ke end times hain, sabse pehle khali hone wala upar. Nayi meeting aayi: agar top wala room free ho chuka hai to pop karo, phir apna end push kar do. Heap ka size hi answer hai. <b>Kab kaunsa?</b> Agar sirf "kitne rooms" poocha hai, sweep line saaf aur tez hai. Agar "kaunsi meeting kis room mein" chahiye, tab heap, kyunki wahan rooms sach mein exist karte hain.</p>
<p><b>Interview line:</b> "Sorting dominates, so it is O(n log n) time and O(n) for the events." Aur agar intervals pehle se sorted diye hain, to bol do ki insert wala case O(n) mein ho jaayega, dobara sort karne ki zaroorat nahi.</p>`,

  plain: `<p>Most patterns are about finding structure in arbitrary data. This one is the opposite: it exploits a constraint the problem hands you, and it only works because of that constraint.</p>
<p>The constraint is that the array contains the numbers 1 to n, or 0 to n-1, possibly with one missing or one duplicated. That is a peculiar thing to be told, and it is a tell. It means every value has a <b>correct index it belongs at</b>, computable with no lookup: value <code>v</code> belongs at index <code>v-1</code>.</p>
<p>So walk the array, and whenever the value in front of you is not home, swap it to where it belongs. Do not advance yet, because the swap brought a new stranger into your current slot. Only move on once the slot is correct.</p>
<p>Once everything that can be home is home, the array is sorted, and more usefully, any index still holding the wrong value is telling you exactly what is missing or duplicated. That second sentence is why the pattern exists at all, because sorting was never the goal.</p>
<p><b>Analogy.</b> Numbered coats on numbered pegs. You do not sort the coats. You pick one up, hang it on its own peg, pick up whatever was already there, and repeat. At the end, an empty peg names the missing coat.</p>`,

  hing: `<p><b>Yeh pattern baaki sabse ulta hai.</b> Zyadatar patterns bikhre hue data mein structure dhoondhte hain. Yeh ek <b>shart (constraint)</b> ka faayda uthata hai jo problem khud tumhe deti hai.</p>
<p><b>Shart kya hai:</b> array mein numbers <b>1 se n tak</b> hain (ya 0 se n-1), shayad ek missing ya ek duplicate ke saath. Yeh line bekaar mein nahi likhi hoti. Iska matlab hai ki har value ko pata hai ki uski <b>jagah kahan hai</b>: value <code>v</code> ka ghar index <code>v-1</code> hai. Na comparison, na hash, na sorting.</p>
<p><b>Loop ajeeb kyun dikhta hai?</b> Kyunki index tabhi aage badhta hai jab current slot <b>sahi</b> ho. Swap karne par tumhare slot mein ek naya ajnabi aa jaata hai, aur uska apna ghar hai. Swap ke baad turant aage badh gaye, to cheezein galat jagah reh jaayengi. <b>Yeh sabse common galti hai.</b></p>
<p><b>Nested loop hai, phir bhi O(n) kaise?</b> Kyunki <b>har swap kam se kam ek value ko hamesha ke liye uski sahi jagah par bitha deta hai</b>, aur woh wahan se kabhi hilti nahi. Isliye poore program mein zyada se zyada n swaps. Yeh wahi amortised argument hai jo monotonic stack mein tha, aur interview mein ise <b>bol kar</b> batana hota hai.</p>
<p><b>Ab asli faayda:</b> pass ke baad ek aur sweep maaro. Agar index <code>i</code> par <code>i+1</code> nahi hai, to <code>i+1</code> <b>missing</b> hai aur jo wahan baitha hai woh <b>duplicate</b> hai. Missing number, repeated number, dono ek hi loop se. Sorting to kabhi maqsad thi hi nahi.</p>
<p><b>Aur sabse important:</b> hash set bhi yeh sab O(n) time mein kar deta hai, aur sabse pehle wahi dimaag mein aata hai. Cyclic sort ka faayda <b>time nahi, SPACE hai</b>: <b>O(1) extra space</b>, kyunki array khud hi record ban jaata hai. Jab problem bole "extra space mat use karo" aur saath mein values ki range bata de, to usne answer do baar bata diya hai.</p>
<p><b>Kab nahi chalega:</b> agar values 1 se n ke bahar hain, to unka koi ghar hi nahi hai. Swap se pehle range check lagao aur bahar wali values chhod do. "First Missing Positive" bilkul yahi case hai, aur wahi guard use solve karta hai.</p>`,

  hing: `<p><b>Problem ki shakal:</b> aksar sawaal ek <b>jodi (pair)</b> ke baare mein hota hai. Do numbers ka sum target, sabse bada container, palindrome ke do sire. Saari jodiyaan check karo to O(n²).</p>
<p><b>Two pointers ka asli funda:</b> do index rakho aur ek <b>niyam</b> banao ki agla kaun aage badhega. Niyam aisa hona chahiye ki har move sirf <b>un candidates ko hataaye jo answer ho hi nahi sakte</b>.</p>
<p><b>Proof (yeh samajh liya to pattern pakka):</b> sorted array hai, <code>a[L] + a[R] > target</code>. Iska matlab <code>a[R]</code> kisi bhi bache hue element ke saath aur bada hi sum dega, kyunki <code>a[L]</code> to already sabse chhota hai. To <code>a[R]</code> <b>poori tarah hata do</b>. Ek comparison mein n candidates gaye. Agar tum apni problem ke liye aisa argument nahi bana pa rahe, to two pointers <b>valid nahi hai</b>.</p>
<p><b>O(n) kyun?</b> Har step mein ek pointer aage badhta hai aur dono ek doosre ki taraf hi aate hain, to milne se pehle zyada se zyada n steps. Time O(n), <b>space O(1)</b>. Yeh O(1) space hi asli jeet hai.</p>
<p><b>Teen variants yaad rakho:</b><br>1. <b>Dono sire se</b> (converging), sorted two-sum, container with most water, palindrome, 3Sum.<br>2. <b>Ek hi taraf, fast aur slow</b>, duplicates hatana, zeroes ko peeche bhejna. Slow pointer batata hai "agla rakha jaane wala element kahan jaayega". In-place O(1) space ka kaam yahi se hota hai.<br>3. <b>Alag speed</b> (Floyd), ek 1 kadam, doosra 2 kadam. Cycle hai to milna <b>pakka</b> hai, kyunki loop ke andar dono ka fasla har step 1 se ghatta hai. Linked list ka cycle <b>O(1) space</b> mein pakda jaata hai, aur middle node bhi ek hi pass mein mil jaata hai.</p>
<p><b>Hash map lein ya two pointers?</b> Hash map: O(n) time, <b>O(n) space</b>, unsorted par bhi chalta hai, original indices milte hain. Two pointers: sort ke baad O(n), <b>O(1) space</b>, par order chahiye. Agar array already sorted hai ya interviewer "O(1) space" bole → two pointers. Agar original index chahiye → hash map.</p>`,
